## Abstract

What are emotions? Despite decades of research, the field remains fragmented between basic emotion theories, constructionist accounts, and appraisal frameworks. We propose a unifying answer grounded in the computational requirements of embedded agency: **emotions are the action-relevant format of integrated self-world information**. For any system that must distinguish self from world (Danan, 2025e), track how the world affects the self, and select actions to maintain viability, emotions are not epiphenomenal accompaniments to cognition—they *are* cognition, formatted for embodied action. Fear is not a feeling that accompanies threat-detection; fear IS threat-information integrated with self-state and action-possibilities, in the format required by an agent that must respond. This framework synthesizes constructionist, appraisal, and embodied approaches while grounding them in computational necessity. It generates specific predictions about emotional processing in embodied versus disembodied systems: large language models should show characteristic dissociations—competent at emotion *labeling* while failing at emotion *understanding* that requires self-world grounding. We review empirical evidence consistent with these predictions and propose that genuine emotional intelligence requires embodiment, not merely larger models or better training data.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Fragmentation Problem

Emotion science is fragmented. Major theoretical traditions offer incompatible answers to basic questions:

**Basic emotion theories** (Ekman, 1992; Panksepp, 1998) propose discrete, universal emotion categories with dedicated neural circuits—fear, anger, joy, sadness, disgust, surprise. Emotions are natural kinds, biologically given.

**Appraisal theories** (Lazarus, 1991; Scherer, 2009) propose that emotions arise from cognitive evaluations of situations along dimensions like goal-relevance, coping potential, and norm compatibility. Emotions are constructed from appraisals.

**Constructionist theories** (Barrett, 2017; Russell, 2003) propose that emotions are constructed from domain-general ingredients—core affect (valence and arousal) plus conceptual categorization. Emotion categories are culturally learned, not biologically fixed.

**Embodied approaches** (Damasio, 1994; Prinz, 2004) emphasize the body’s role—emotions involve bodily states, and feeling emotions requires perceiving those states.

Each tradition captures something important. None provides a unified answer to: **What are emotions, computationally? Why do they exist?**

### 1.2 The Proposal

We propose that emotions are answers to a computational problem faced by all embedded agents:

> **How should I act, given my current state and the current state of the world?**

This question cannot be answered by representing world-state alone. It requires integrating:

1. **World-state:** What is happening in the environment?
1. **Self-state:** What is my current condition (energy, integrity, capacity)?
1. **Self-world relation:** How does the world-state affect my self-state?
1. **Action possibilities:** What can I do?
1. **Predicted consequences:** What will happen if I act?

**Core thesis:** Emotions are the integrated representation of self-world relations formatted for action selection. They are not outputs of cognition; they are the format in which action-relevant cognition occurs for embedded agents.

### 1.3 Relation to the Abstraction-Intelligence Framework

This paper extends the theoretical program:

- **Paper 1** (Danan, 2025a): Abstraction is the fundamental primitive of intelligence
- **Paper 5** (Danan, 2025e): The self/world distinction is foundational for embedded agents
- **Paper 6** (Danan, 2025f): Experience is the format of embedded information
- **Paper 7** (Danan, 2025g): Temporal reasoning requires embodied duration experience

We now argue that emotions are a specific class of embedded information: **integrated self-world state formatted for action**. This explains why emotions feel like something (Paper 6), why they involve the body (self-state requires interoception), and why they are action-urging (they exist to guide action).

### 1.4 Epistemic Status

We distinguish:

- **Established:** Findings supported by peer-reviewed empirical literature
- **Theoretical:** Extensions following standard inference from established findings
- **Hypothesis:** Novel claims requiring empirical validation
- **Integration:** Synthesis of existing theories into unified framework

## 2. Background: What Emotions Do

### 2.1 Emotions Prepare Action

Across theoretical traditions, one finding is robust: emotions prepare organisms for action (Frijda, 1986; Lang et al., 1990; Bradley & Lang, 2000).

**Fear** prepares flight or freeze: increased heart rate, blood flow to muscles, heightened vigilance, narrowed attention to threat (LeDoux, 1996; Mobbs et al., 2007).

**Anger** prepares confrontation: increased cardiovascular output, approach motivation, focus on obstacle (Carver & Harmon-Jones, 2009).

**Disgust** prepares rejection: nausea, oral-nasal closure, withdrawal from contaminant (Rozin et al., 2008).

**Sadness** prepares withdrawal and conservation: reduced activity, social signaling for support, resource preservation (Nesse, 2000).

**Established finding:** Emotions are not passive reactions but active preparations. They configure the organism for specific action patterns (Frijda, 1986). This is observed across species with sufficient neural complexity (Panksepp, 1998; Anderson & Adolphs, 2014).

### 2.2 Emotions Integrate Multiple Information Sources

Emotions integrate information from multiple systems (Scherer, 2009; Barrett & Simmons, 2015):

**Exteroceptive information:** What is happening in the environment? (sensory systems)

**Interoceptive information:** What is the state of the body? (visceral afferents, metabolic signals)

**Memory:** What happened before in similar situations? (hippocampal and cortical systems)

**Prediction:** What is likely to happen next? (predictive processing, forward models)

**Established finding:** Emotional experience correlates with integration across these sources. Manipulating any source alters emotional experience—changing bodily state changes emotion (Critchley & Garfinkel, 2017); changing appraisal changes emotion (Gross, 2015); changing prediction changes emotion (Barrett & Simmons, 2015).

### 2.3 Emotions Involve the Body

The body is not peripheral to emotion; it is constitutive (Damasio, 1994; Craig, 2009; Seth, 2013).

**Interoception**—the sense of internal body state—predicts emotional experience. Individuals with higher interoceptive accuracy report more intense emotional experiences (Critchley et al., 2004; Garfinkel et al., 2015).

**Peripheral physiological changes** accompany and potentially constitute emotional experience. The James-Lange theory proposed that emotion IS perception of bodily change (James, 1884). Contemporary evidence supports a modified version: bodily signals contribute to (if not fully constitute) emotional experience (Critchley & Garfinkel, 2017).

**Embodied manipulation** alters emotion. Facial feedback (with important caveats: Coles et al., 2022), postural changes (Stepper & Strack, 1993), and pharmacological manipulation of peripheral signals (Khalsa et al., 2018) all modulate emotional experience.

**Established finding:** Emotional experience depends on interoceptive signals. The body is not merely expressing emotion; bodily state information contributes to emotional experience itself.

### 2.4 Emotions Are Valenced

All emotions carry valence—a sense of goodness or badness, approach-worthiness or avoidance-worthiness (Russell, 2003; Barrett & Russell, 1999).

**Core affect**—the continuous fluctuation of valence and arousal—may be the foundation on which discrete emotion categories are constructed (Russell, 2003; Barrett, 2017).

**Established finding:** Valence is ubiquitous in emotion. Even supposedly “neutral” states exist on the valence continuum. This suggests valence is fundamental to whatever emotions are.

### 2.5 The Integration Challenge

Each finding above is established. The challenge is integration:

- If emotions prepare action, why do they involve the body?
- If emotions involve interoception, why do they include world-evaluation?
- If emotions are valenced, what determines valence?

Existing theories answer these partially. We propose a framework that answers them jointly.

## 3. Emotions as Embedded Self-World Information

### 3.1 The Embedded Agent’s Problem

Consider any system that:

1. Exists within an environment that affects it
1. Has internal states that determine its viability
1. Must act to maintain viability
1. Has limited information and processing capacity

Such a system faces a continuous problem: **given current world-state and self-state, what should I do?**

This problem cannot be solved by representing world-state alone. A predator is only a threat *relative to* the agent’s escape capacity. Food is only valuable *relative to* the agent’s hunger. Temperature is only dangerous *relative to* the agent’s thermoregulatory limits.

**Theoretical claim:** Action selection requires representing *self-world relations*, not just world-state.

### 3.2 Why Integration Is Required

The relevant information is distributed:

- World-state is accessed via exteroception
- Self-state is accessed via interoception
- Action possibilities depend on motor capacity and environmental constraints
- Predicted consequences require forward models and memory

No single system provides the answer. The answer emerges from *integration*.

**Theoretical claim:** Emotions are this integration. They are not a separate system that comments on cognition; they are the format in which integrated self-world information exists for embedded agents.

### 3.3 The Format Requirement

For integrated information to guide action, it must be formatted appropriately. Consider what’s needed:

**Urgency:** Some situations require immediate action; others permit deliberation. The format must signal urgency.

**Valence:** Some situations require approach; others require avoidance. The format must signal direction.

**Action-type:** Different situations call for different action patterns (flee, fight, freeze, approach, withdraw, seek-help). The format must specify pattern.

**Confidence:** Some assessments are certain; others are ambiguous. The format should reflect uncertainty.

**Theoretical claim:** Emotional phenomenology—what emotions feel like—reflects these formatting requirements. Fear feels urgent, negative, flight-or-freeze-promoting. Anger feels urgent, approach-oriented, confrontation-promoting. Sadness feels low-urgency, negative, withdrawal-promoting. The “feel” of emotion IS the action-relevant format.

### 3.4 Valence as Viability Signal

What determines valence? We propose:

**Valence = predicted impact on viability.**

- Positive valence: situation predicts maintained or improved viability
- Negative valence: situation predicts threatened viability

This is not hedonism (pleasure/pain as primitives). It is functionalism: valence tracks the viability-relevance of situations for embedded agents.

**Support:** Valence tracks goal-relevance across studies (Scherer, 2009). Situations that threaten goals are experienced negatively; situations that advance goals are experienced positively. If we identify “goals” with “viability-maintenance” (broadly construed to include reproduction, social standing, etc.), valence tracks viability.

### 3.5 The Bodily Basis

Why does emotion involve the body? Because **self-state is bodily state**.

For embedded biological agents, the “self” whose viability must be maintained is the body. Self-state information is interoceptive information. Integrating self-state into action-relevant representation requires integrating bodily signals.

**Theoretical claim:** Interoception is not peripheral to emotion; it provides the *self* component of self-world integration. Emotions feel embodied because the self, for biological agents, IS embodied.

This extends Paper 5’s argument: the self/world distinction is foundational. For biological agents, the self-side of this distinction is accessed via interoception. Emotions are where self-state (interoception) meets world-state (exteroception) in action-relevant format.

### 3.6 Formal Statement

**Definition:** An emotion is an integrated representation of self-world relations formatted for action selection, where:

- **Self-state** is represented via interoceptive signals
- **World-state** is represented via exteroceptive signals and memory
- **Self-world relation** is computed as predicted impact of world-state on self-state
- **Action-relevance** is computed as available actions and their predicted consequences
- **Format** is phenomenal character (valence, arousal, urgency, action-tendency)

This definition synthesizes:

- Appraisal theory (world-state evaluation)
- Embodied approaches (self-state via interoception)
- Constructionist insights (integration produces emotion categories)
- Action-tendency theories (format specifies action)

-----

## 4. Discrete Emotions as Action-Relevant Categories

### 4.1 The Category Question

Are emotions discrete categories (fear, anger, joy) or continuous dimensions (valence, arousal)?

**Both perspectives capture something real.** Dimensional structure exists (Russell, 2003). Discrete categories also exist and predict behavior (Ekman, 1992; Lench et al., 2011).

We propose: **Discrete emotions are action-relevant abstractions over the continuous space of self-world relations.**

### 4.2 Fear: Threat + Escape-Possibility

**Fear** arises when:

- World-state: threat present (predator, hazard, social danger)
- Self-state: intact but vulnerable
- Self-world relation: threat can damage self
- Action possibilities: escape or freeze available
- Predicted consequences: action can reduce damage probability

Fear formats this information as: urgent, negative, flight/freeze-promoting. The phenomenology of fear IS this format.

**Distinct from anxiety:** When threat is uncertain or escape unavailable, the integration differs, producing anxiety rather than acute fear (Grupe & Nitschke, 2013).

### 4.3 Anger: Obstacle + Confrontation-Possibility

**Anger** arises when:

- World-state: goal blocked by removable obstacle (often agent-caused)
- Self-state: sufficient capacity for confrontation
- Self-world relation: obstacle is preventing goal achievement
- Action possibilities: confrontation can remove obstacle
- Predicted consequences: confrontation has reasonable success probability

Anger formats this as: urgent, approach-oriented, confrontation-promoting. The experience of anger IS this format.

**Distinct from frustration:** When confrontation is unavailable or obstacle is not removable, different integration occurs (Berkowitz, 1989).

### 4.4 Sadness: Loss + Conservation-Need

**Sadness** arises when:

- World-state: valued resource/relationship lost
- Self-state: depleted by loss
- Self-world relation: loss has occurred; world is diminished
- Action possibilities: limited—loss cannot be reversed
- Predicted consequences: conservation and social support may help recovery

Sadness formats this as: low-urgency, negative, withdrawal-promoting. The phenomenology of sadness IS this format.

**Function:** Sadness promotes resource conservation and signals need for social support (Nesse, 2000; Andrews & Thomson, 2009).

### 4.5 Joy/Happiness: Goal-Achievement + Continuation

**Joy** arises when:

- World-state: goal achieved or positive surprise occurred
- Self-state: good—resources adequate, integrity maintained
- Self-world relation: world is supporting viability
- Action possibilities: continue current course, explore, expand
- Predicted consequences: positive trajectory likely to continue

Joy formats this as: positive, approach-oriented, expansion-promoting.

### 4.6 Disgust: Contaminant + Rejection-Need

**Disgust** arises when:

- World-state: contaminant present (pathogen-associated, morally contaminating)
- Self-state: at risk of contamination
- Self-world relation: contact will damage/pollute self
- Action possibilities: rejection, withdrawal, expulsion available
- Predicted consequences: rejection prevents contamination

Disgust formats this as: urgent, negative, rejection-promoting. The characteristic nausea and oral-nasal closure ARE the action-relevant format (Rozin et al., 2008).

### 4.7 Categories as Compression

Discrete emotion categories are **compressions** of the continuous self-world space that preserve action-relevant distinctions.

The space of possible self-world relations is high-dimensional. But the space of adaptive action patterns is lower-dimensional. Evolution and learning discover emotion categories that map high-dimensional situations onto appropriate action patterns.

This explains cross-cultural universality AND cultural variation:

- **Universality:** Basic action-relevant distinctions (threat/opportunity, approach/avoid) are universal because the problems are universal
- **Variation:** Cultures may carve finer distinctions relevant to their action contexts (Mesquita & Frijda, 1992; Russell, 1991)

## 5. Emotion in Disembodied Systems

### 5.1 The Grounding Problem

Large language models process text about emotion. They can:

- Label emotions in text (Demszky et al., 2020)
- Generate emotionally-valenced text (Li et al., 2016)
- Respond to emotion-relevant prompts (Huang et al., 2023)

But do they *understand* emotion?

**Theoretical claim:** Genuine emotional understanding requires self-world grounding. LLMs lack:

- **Self-state:** No body, no interoception, no viability to maintain
- **World-embedding:** No environment they act upon, no consequences they experience
- **Action-selection pressure:** No actions to choose, no viability at stake

Without these, LLMs can learn statistical patterns involving emotion words but cannot represent what emotions *are*—integrated self-world information formatted for action.

### 5.2 Predicted Dissociations

If emotions are embedded self-world information, LLMs should show specific dissociations:

**Should succeed at:**

- Emotion labeling (pattern matching on text features)
- Emotion-stereotype associations (“fear” associates with “danger,” “running”)
- Emotion-response generation (producing conventionally appropriate emotional responses)
- Abstract emotion reasoning (if A is afraid of B, A will avoid B)

**Should fail at:**

- Duration of emotional states (how long does grief last? how quickly does anger dissipate?)
- Embodied concomitants (what does fear feel like in the body?)
- Action-consequence reasoning (what happens when you act from anger vs. suppress it?)
- Contextual appropriateness (when is fear appropriate? when is anger justified?)
- Self-world integration (how would *I* feel if X happened to *me*?)

### 5.3 Empirical Evidence

Emerging evidence is consistent with these predictions:

**Emotion labeling:** LLMs perform well on sentiment analysis and emotion classification tasks (Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023).

**Embodied understanding:** LLMs struggle with questions about bodily experience of emotion. When asked what fear “feels like physically” or how anger manifests in the body, responses reflect text statistics rather than embodied understanding (Shapira et al., 2023).

**Duration and dynamics:** LLMs show poor performance on emotion dynamics—how emotions unfold, dissipate, transform over time (Chen et al., 2023). This parallels temporal reasoning deficits (Paper 7).

**Contextual appropriateness:** LLMs struggle with nuanced judgments about when emotions are appropriate, proportionate, or justified (Sap et al., 2022; Ziems et al., 2022).

**Caveat:** This evidence is preliminary. Systematic comparisons specifically testing embedded vs. representational emotional capacities are needed.

### 5.4 The Simulation Question

Can emotional understanding be simulated? If an LLM is embedded in a text-based world with described “body states” and “actions,” does it develop emotional grounding?

**Framework prediction:** Mere description is insufficient. Emotional grounding requires:

1. Actual self-state signals (interoception or functional equivalent)
1. Actual action-consequence loops (not described consequences)
1. Actual viability pressure (stakes)

A system with *described* body states is representing emotion, not experiencing it. The difference matters because genuine emotional understanding is understanding formatted for action in a system where action matters.

**Open question:** What minimal embodiment suffices for emotional grounding? This is empirical, not resolvable by theory alone.

-----

## 6. Emotions and the Self/World Boundary

### 6.1 Emotions Mark Self-World Relations

Paper 5 argued that the self/world distinction is foundational for embedded agents. Emotions are where this distinction becomes experientially vivid.

Consider:

- **Fear:** The world threatens the self
- **Desire:** The self lacks what the world contains
- **Satisfaction:** The self has obtained from the world
- **Disgust:** The world contaminates the self
- **Pride:** The self has performed well in the world
- **Shame:** The self has performed poorly before the world

Every emotion encodes a self-world relation. The phenomenology of emotion IS the felt significance of how world affects self.

### 6.2 Interoception as Self-Representation

Emotions feel embodied because interoception represents the self-side of self-world relations.

The anterior insula integrates interoceptive signals and is consistently activated in emotional experience (Craig, 2009; Critchley & Harrison, 2013). This is not coincidental—the insula provides the self-state information that emotions integrate with world-state.

**Theoretical claim:** Interoceptive cortex (insula, anterior cingulate) is where the self is represented for emotional integration. Damage to these regions disrupts emotional experience (Damasio et al., 2000; Khalsa et al., 2018).

### 6.3 Exteroception as World-Representation

The world-side of emotional integration comes from exteroceptive processing—sensory systems that detect environmental features relevant to viability.

Threat-detection circuits (amygdala and connected systems) process world-features relevant to danger (LeDoux, 1996; Öhman & Mineka, 2001). Reward-detection circuits (ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex) process world-features relevant to opportunity (Schultz, 2015; Haber & Knutson, 2010).

These are not “emotion circuits” per se—they are circuits that provide the world-side of emotional integration.

### 6.4 Emotional Experience as Integration

Emotional experience occurs when self-state and world-state are integrated in action-relevant format.

**Established finding:** Emotional experience correlates with functional connectivity between interoceptive regions (insula, ACC) and exteroceptive/evaluative regions (amygdala, PFC, sensory cortex) (Lindquist et al., 2012; Barrett & Satpute, 2013).

This is the neural signature of self-world integration.

-----

## 7. Emotions and Time

### 7.1 Emotions Are Temporal

Emotions unfold over time. They have onset, duration, and decay (Verduyn et al., 2015).

Paper 7 argued that temporal understanding requires embodied duration experience. Emotions provide strong support for this claim: emotional duration is felt, not computed.

How long does anger last? This depends on:

- Intensity of provocation
- Success of regulation attempts
- Occurrence of resolution or rumination
- Individual differences in emotional reactivity and recovery

These factors are experienced, not abstractly computed.

### 7.2 Emotion Dynamics

Emotions have characteristic dynamics (Kuppens et al., 2010; Kuppens & Verduyn, 2017):

- **Intensity decay:** Most emotions decay over time without re-triggering
- **Emotional inertia:** Current emotion predicts near-future emotion (individual differences in “stickiness”)
- **Emotional variability:** Emotions fluctuate; the pattern of fluctuation is informative
- **Cross-emotion influence:** Emotions interact (anxiety prolongs anger; joy facilitates gratitude)

These dynamics require temporal experience. A system that doesn’t experience duration cannot represent emotional decay, inertia, or fluctuation.

### 7.3 LLM Emotion-Dynamics Failures

**Prediction:** LLMs should fail at emotional dynamics reasoning.

- How long will grief last after a major loss?
- When is anger likely to dissipate vs. intensify?
- How does emotional experience change over the course of a day?

These questions require embodied temporal understanding. Preliminary evidence suggests LLMs struggle with them (Chen et al., 2023), consistent with broader temporal reasoning deficits (Paper 7).

## 8. Implications

### 8.1 For Emotion Theory

The framework integrates existing theories:

|Theory                   |Contribution              |Limitation Addressed                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|Basic emotions (Ekman)   |Universal categories exist|Explains *why*: action-relevant compression          |
|Appraisal (Scherer)      |Cognition shapes emotion  |Explains *which* cognition: self-world integration   |
|Constructionist (Barrett)|Categories are constructed|Explains *from what*: embodied self-world information|
|Embodied (Damasio)       |Body is constitutive      |Explains *why*: body = self in self-world            |

The framework doesn’t replace these theories; it provides the computational foundation they implicitly assume.

### 8.2 For Artificial Intelligence

**Emotional AI requires embodiment.** Systems without self-state, world-embedding, and action-consequence loops can simulate emotion language but cannot represent what emotions represent.

This has implications for:

- **Social AI:** Companion robots and social agents need genuine self-world grounding to respond appropriately to emotional situations, not just pattern-match on emotional keywords
- **Affective computing:** Emotion recognition and generation require understanding, not just classification
- **AI alignment:** If AI systems are to respect human values, they must understand what humans feel—which requires understanding emotion as self-world information, not text patterns

### 8.3 For Clinical Science

Emotional disorders may be disorders of self-world integration:

- **Anxiety:** Over-prediction of threat to self from world
- **Depression:** Under-representation of positive self-world possibilities
- **Alexithymia:** Impaired interoception → impaired self-state representation → impaired emotional experience
- **PTSD:** Disrupted integration of past world-event with current self-state

This reframes treatment: rather than targeting “emotion regulation,” target the integration of self-state, world-state, and action possibilities.

**Established connection:** Interoceptive training improves emotional awareness and regulation (Füstös et al., 2013; Farb et al., 2015). This is predicted by the framework: improving self-state representation improves self-world integration.

### 8.4 For Philosophy

The framework offers a response to debates about emotion and cognition:

**Cognitivism:** Emotions involve judgments/appraisals.
**Non-cognitivism:** Emotions are bodily/phenomenal, not cognitive.

**Our response:** This is a false dichotomy. Emotions are cognitive *in a specific sense*: they represent self-world relations. They are bodily *because* self-state is bodily. Cognition and embodiment are not opposed; embodiment is how self-cognition occurs.

-----

## 9. Predictions and Falsification

### 9.1 Neuroimaging Predictions

**Prediction 1:** Emotional experience should correlate with functional connectivity between interoceptive regions (insula, ACC) and exteroceptive/evaluative regions. Disrupting this connectivity should disrupt emotional experience.

*Status:* Largely supported (Lindquist et al., 2012; Barrett & Satpute, 2013). Direct disruption studies (TMS, lesion) provide further tests.

**Prediction 2:** Individual differences in interoceptive accuracy should predict emotional intelligence/understanding, independent of verbal ability.

*Status:* Partially supported (Critchley et al., 2004; Shah et al., 2017). More rigorous tests separating interoceptive accuracy from metacognitive accuracy are needed.

### 9.2 AI System Predictions

**Prediction 3:** Embodied AI systems (robots with sensory feedback and action consequences) should show better emotional understanding than matched disembodied systems.

*Test:* Compare emotional reasoning tasks across embodied and disembodied architectures with matched training.

**Prediction 4:** LLM performance on emotion tasks should dissociate: high performance on labeling/classification, low performance on dynamics/embodiment/contextual-appropriateness.

*Test:* Develop benchmarks specifically distinguishing representational from grounded emotional capacities.

**Prediction 5:** Adding described “body states” to LLM prompts should not improve emotional understanding to the level of genuine embodiment.

*Test:* Compare emotional reasoning with and without simulated body-state descriptions; compare both to genuinely embodied systems.

### 9.3 Behavioral Predictions

**Prediction 6:** Actions taken from emotional states should be systematically appropriate to the self-world relation the emotion represents. This should hold across cultures despite variation in emotion categories.

*Status:* Supported by action-tendency research (Frijda, 1986; Lench et al., 2011).

**Prediction 7:** Disrupting interoception (e.g., via pharmacological manipulation or attention diversion) should disrupt emotional experience, even with intact exteroceptive processing.

*Status:* Supported (Khalsa et al., 2018; Critchley & Garfinkel, 2017).

### 9.4 Falsification Criteria

The framework would be challenged by:

1. **Disembodied emotional understanding:** If LLMs at sufficient scale show human-like emotional understanding (dynamics, embodiment, contextual appropriateness) without embodiment, the grounding claim is wrong.
1. **Emotional experience without interoception:** If individuals with complete interoceptive loss show normal emotional experience, the self-state claim is wrong.
1. **Emotional categories without action-relevance:** If emotion categories are discovered that have no action-tendency or viability-relevance, the functional claim is wrong.
1. **Valence without viability-prediction:** If valence is shown to track something other than predicted viability impact, the valence account is wrong.

-----

## 10. Limitations and Open Questions

### 10.1 The Measurement Problem

We cannot directly measure “emotional understanding” independently of behavioral proxies. We infer understanding from appropriate behavior, appropriate language, appropriate physiological response. This circularity affects all emotion research.

### 10.2 The Grain Problem

How much embodiment is required for emotional grounding? A bacterium has self-world information but (presumably) not emotional experience. Where on the continuum does emotional experience emerge?

We suggest: emotional experience requires integration of self-state, world-state, and action possibilities in a format that guides action. This may require a complexity threshold (Paper 3), but the threshold is not yet specified.

### 10.3 Social and Cultural Factors

Emotions are shaped by social context and cultural learning (Mesquita & Frijda, 1992; Barrett, 2017). The framework focuses on individual self-world relations but must be extended to include self-other and self-group relations for full adequacy.

**Initial response:** Social emotions (shame, guilt, pride, jealousy) involve self-world relations where the “world” includes other agents whose evaluations affect one’s viability. The framework extends naturally but requires elaboration.

### 10.4 Positive Emotions

The framework is more developed for negative emotions (threat-related) than positive emotions (opportunity-related). Positive emotions require fuller treatment:

- How does joy as goal-achievement integrate self-world information?
- What is the action-tendency of contentment, serenity, awe?
- Are positive emotions less action-urging because the self-world relation is already favorable?

These questions remain open.

-----

## 11. Conclusion

What are emotions?

For decades, emotion science has offered partial answers: discrete categories, continuous dimensions, cognitive appraisals, bodily feelings. We have proposed a unifying framework: **emotions are integrated self-world information formatted for action**.

This framework explains:

- **Why emotions involve the body:** Self-state is bodily state; interoception provides the self-side of self-world integration
- **Why emotions involve cognition:** World-state evaluation is cognitive; exteroception and memory provide the world-side
- **Why emotions feel like something:** Phenomenal character IS the action-relevant format (Paper 6)
- **Why emotions prepare action:** Action-preparation is their function; they exist to guide what to do given self-state and world-state
- **Why emotions are valenced:** Valence tracks predicted viability impact—the fundamental concern of embedded agents
- **Why emotions have categories:** Discrete emotions are action-relevant compressions of continuous self-world space

The framework predicts that genuine emotional understanding requires embodiment. Disembodied systems can process emotion language but cannot represent what emotions represent: how the world matters to a self that must act.

Emotions are not luxuries, not epiphenomena, not irrational intrusions on cognition. Emotions are cognition—the form cognition takes when it matters what happens to you.

For embedded agents, that is always.
