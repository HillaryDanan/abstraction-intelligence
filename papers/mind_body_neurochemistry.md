## Highlights

- Major neurochemical systems show coordinated central-peripheral effects: serotonin (gut/mood), dopamine (movement/motivation), cortisol (metabolism/cognition), cytokines (immunity/sickness behavior), GLP-1 (satiation/reward)
- We propose these systems provide **factorized self-state signals** for compositional integration with world-state
- The compositional interpretation predicts: cross-domain effects from single-factor modulation, systematic transfer structure, and dissociations between factors
- GLP-1 agonists provide a current test case: cross-domain effects on food, alcohol, and possibly compulsive behaviors
- Key uncertainty: whether neurochemistry implements genuinely compositional structure or “compositional” just redescribes shared mechanisms

## Abstract

Neurochemical systems show a striking pattern: coordinated effects across brain and body. Serotonin regulates gut motility AND mood. Dopamine influences movement AND motivation. Cortisol affects metabolism AND cognition. Cytokines produce immune responses AND sickness behavior. GLP-1 signals satiation AND modulates reward processing.

Why this coordination? We propose that neurochemistry implements **compositional self-state abstraction**. For any agent that must act in the world, internal state (energy, integrity, arousal, motivation) must combine with external context (opportunities, threats) to guide action. We propose that major neurochemical systems provide factorized self-state signals—distinct dimensions that combine with world-state to produce context-appropriate behavior.

This is more than “shared mechanisms.” The compositional interpretation predicts specific structure: modulating one factor should affect all contexts that factor participates in (cross-domain effects), while sparing other factors (dissociations). Effect sizes across domains should be systematically related (transfer structure), and novel contexts should be affected without specific learning (compositional generalization).

GLP-1 agonists provide a current test case. Originally developed for diabetes, they show unexpected effects on alcohol craving and possibly compulsive behaviors. The compositional interpretation: GLP-1 modulates “appetitive intensity”—a factor distinct from dopaminergic “effort-investment”—that combines with any reward context. We specify predictions, acknowledge substantial uncertainty about whether the compositional framework adds explanatory value beyond simpler accounts, and propose empirical tests.

## 1. The Pattern: Coordinated Central-Peripheral Effects

### 1.1 The Empirical Observation

Major neurochemical systems show effects across traditional brain-body divides:

**Serotonin**: ~95% resides in the gastrointestinal tract, regulating motility and secretion. Central serotonin modulates mood, behavioral inhibition, and impulse control (Gershon & Tack, 2007; Cools et al., 2008). SSRIs affect both GI function and emotional regulation.

**Dopamine**: Central pathways mediate movement, motivation, and reward learning. Peripheral dopamine influences renal function and gut motility (Salamone et al., 2007; Eisenhofer et al., 1997). Parkinson’s disease produces both motor and motivational symptoms.

**Norepinephrine**: Central release produces arousal, attention, and stress responses. Peripheral release mediates cardiovascular and metabolic mobilization (Sara, 2009; Molinoff, 1984). The system coordinates psychological and physiological arousal.

**Cortisol**: Metabolic effects (gluconeogenesis, immune modulation) and cognitive effects (memory consolidation, stress responding) are coordinated through HPA axis dynamics (Lupien et al., 2009; McEwen, 2008).

**Cytokines**: Peripheral immune signaling produces central “sickness behavior”—fatigue, social withdrawal, anhedonia—that coordinates behavioral with immunological responses (Dantzer et al., 2008; Miller & Raison, 2016).

**GLP-1**: Gut-derived satiation signal with receptors in hypothalamus, VTA, and NAc. Effects extend beyond food intake to reward processing broadly (Müller et al., 2019; Dickson et al., 2012).

### 1.2 The Question

Why this coordination? Three possibilities:

1. **Coincidence**: Central and peripheral systems evolved separately; coordination is accidental overlap
1. **Signaling economy**: Using the same molecules for related functions is metabolically efficient
1. **Functional architecture**: Coordination reflects how intelligent systems must organize internal state for action

We develop the third possibility.

## 2. The Framework: Compositional Self-State Abstraction

### 2.1 The Problem of Embedded Action

Any agent embedded in an environment faces a problem: action must be guided by the relationship between internal state and external context.

- Food is valuable only relative to hunger
- Threats matter only relative to capacity to respond
- Opportunities are worth pursuing only relative to current resources

This requires integrating:

- **Self-state**: Energy, integrity, arousal, motivation, immune status
- **World-state**: Opportunities, threats, social context, resource availability

The integration must be formatted for action—not just represented but usable for behavioral guidance.

### 2.2 The Compositional Proposal

We propose that major neurochemical systems provide **factorized self-state signals**:

|System        |Self-State Dimension                  |Functional Role                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Serotonin     |Metabolic adequacy                    |Resource status for inhibition vs. action       |
|Dopamine      |Incentive salience / effort-investment|Motivation to pursue rewards                    |
|Norepinephrine|Arousal                               |Urgency and attentional focus                   |
|Cortisol      |Resource mobilization                 |Sustained challenge response                    |
|Cytokines     |Integrity status                      |Infection/damage requiring behavioral adjustment|
|GLP-1         |Appetitive intensity                  |Strength of wanting/craving                     |

**Factorized** means these are distinct dimensions, not redundant signals. **Compositional** means they combine with world-state to produce context-appropriate outputs.

### 2.3 What “Compositional” Adds

A critic might ask: how does this differ from “shared mechanisms” or “coordinated signaling”?

The compositional interpretation makes specific predictions that “shared mechanisms” does not:

**1. Cross-domain effects from single-factor modulation**

Modulating one factor should affect ALL contexts that factor participates in. If GLP-1 encodes “appetitive intensity,” reducing it should reduce food craving, alcohol craving, gambling urges, and any appetitive state—not just metabolically-related rewards.

**2. Dissociations between factors**

Different factors should be independently modulable. If dopamine encodes “effort-investment” and GLP-1 encodes “appetitive intensity,” you should be able to:

- Reduce wanting (GLP-1) while preserving willingness to work (DA)
- Reduce effort-investment (DA) while preserving wanting intensity (GLP-1)

**3. Systematic transfer structure**

Effects should not be idiosyncratic across domains. If GLP-1 agonists reduce food craving by 40%, alcohol craving reduction should be predictable from that—related by the factor’s contribution to each context.

**4. Novel generalization**

Effects should extend to contexts never experienced during the intervention. If GLP-1 modulates a compositional factor, it should affect craving for novel rewards—not just rewards with established GLP-1 circuit involvement.

### 2.4 The Precision Problem

We should be honest about the analogy’s limits.

In compositional semantics (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; Partee, 1995), there are explicit combination rules: meaning(“brown dog”) = f(meaning(“brown”), meaning(“dog”), syntactic structure). The function f is formally specified.

Here we have:

Craving(X) = f(appetitive_intensity, value(X), availability(X))

But f is not specified. Is it multiplicative? Additive? Threshold-gated?

**What the framework provides**: Predictions about transfer, generalization, and dissociation—testable without specifying f.

**What the framework lacks**: Formal precision about combination rules.

**Honest framing**: “Compositional” here means “factorized signals that combine with context in ways enabling novel generalization.” This is weaker than formal compositionality but may be scientifically productive if predictions are confirmed.

## 3. The Relationship Between Factors

### 3.1 Dopamine and GLP-1: Distinct or Overlapping?

A key question: Are dopamine and GLP-1 distinct factors, or does GLP-1 simply modulate dopamine?

**Evidence for interaction**: GLP-1 receptors are expressed on VTA dopamine neurons. GLP-1 agonists reduce dopamine release in NAc (Dickson et al., 2012; Mietlicki-Baase et al., 2014).

**The compositional interpretation**: GLP-1 and dopamine may encode DIFFERENT dimensions:

- Dopamine: Incentive salience—the motivational “pull” of reward-associated stimuli (Berridge & Robinson, 1998)
- GLP-1: Appetitive intensity—the strength of wanting states

These are conceptually dissociable: you can want intensely but be unwilling to work (high GLP-1 effect, low DA), or work hard for something you don’t intensely want (low GLP-1 effect, high DA).

**Alternative**: GLP-1 effects are entirely DA-mediated. GLP-1 reduces DA signaling → reduced incentive salience → cross-domain effects. No separate “appetitive intensity” factor.

**Empirical test**: Do GLP-1 agonists produce dissociations from DA manipulations?

|Dimension         |DA Manipulation      |GLP-1 Manipulation (if distinct)|
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
|Wanting intensity |Affected             |Affected                        |
|Effort-willingness|Affected             |Spared                          |
|Liking/pleasure   |Maybe affected       |Spared                          |
|Motor effects     |Affected (high doses)|Spared                          |

If GLP-1 agonists reduce wanting while sparing effort-willingness, they modulate something beyond (or in addition to) DA. If both are equally affected, the simpler DA-mediated account suffices.

### 3.2 The Multi-Factor Hypothesis

The compositional framework proposes MULTIPLE factors:

- Serotonin and dopamine are not redundant—they encode different dimensions
- GLP-1 and dopamine may not be redundant—one could modulate the other while encoding distinct information
- Factor interactions (GLP-1 gating DA) don’t eliminate factor distinctness

**The key prediction**: Selective modulation should produce selective effects. If neurochemistry is compositional:

- SSRI → affects metabolic/inhibitory dimension; spares effort-investment dimension
- DA agonist → affects effort-investment; may spare appetitive intensity
- GLP-1 agonist → affects appetitive intensity; should spare effort-investment (if distinct from DA)

If these dissociations don’t obtain—if every modulation affects everything proportionally—the compositional framework loses value and “general shared mechanism” suffices.

## 4. GLP-1 as Test Case

### 4.1 The Unexpected Findings

GLP-1 agonists provide a current test of compositional predictions because their effects are extending beyond expected domains:

**Established**: Weight loss, reduced food intake (Wilding et al., 2021)

**Emerging**: Reduced alcohol consumption in rodents and preliminary human trials (Shirazi et al., 2013; Klausen et al., 2022; Leggio et al., 2023)

**Preliminary**: Case reports of reduced gambling, compulsive shopping, skin-picking (Richards et al., 2023)

### 4.2 Interpreting the Pattern

**Coincidental overlap**: GLP-1 receptors happen to be in reward circuits; effects on alcohol are anatomical accident.

**General dampening**: GLP-1 reduces reward circuit gain broadly.

**Compositional factor**: GLP-1 modulates “appetitive intensity” that combines with any reward context.

### 4.3 What Would Distinguish These?

|Prediction                       |Coincidental  |Dampening|Compositional             |
|---------------------------------|--------------|---------|--------------------------|
|Affect novel rewards             |No            |Maybe    |Yes                       |
|Systematic cross-domain structure|No            |Maybe    |Yes                       |
|Dissociate from effort           |No prediction |No       |Yes                       |
|Predicted side effects           |Domain-limited|Global   |Wanting-specific anhedonia|

**The sharpest test**: Does reducing “appetitive intensity” (via GLP-1) spare “effort-investment” (DA-mediated)? If yes, they’re distinct factors. If no, GLP-1 may simply modulate DA.

### 4.4 Novel Reward Generalization: Operationalizing the Test

A reviewer might ask: how do you test “novel rewards” in adult humans?

**Approaches**:

1. **Cross-domain transfer without training**: Patients treated for obesity with no alcohol history. Does GLP-1 reduce alcohol cue reactivity even though alcohol was never targeted?
1. **Lab-based novel rewards**: Introduce new game-like tasks with abstract point rewards. Measure approach motivation on vs. off GLP-1.
1. **Individual differences**: Among GLP-1 patients, correlate food craving reduction with reduction in other cravings. Compositional predicts systematic correlation; coincidental predicts independence.
1. **Proportionality test**: If GLP-1 reduces food craving by 40%, does it reduce other appetitive states proportionally (same factor, different contexts) or idiosyncratically (different mechanisms)?

## 5. Implications for Understanding Self-State Representation

### 5.1 Connection to Cognitive Science

The framework connects to established work on:

**Compositionality in cognition**: Language, concepts, and motor control show compositional structure—reusable primitives combining to produce novel outputs (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988; Murphy, 1988; Flash & Hochner, 2005). If neurochemistry is compositional, internal state representation shares this property.

**Interoception and self-representation**: Interoceptive signals provide the brain’s access to body state (Craig, 2009; Seth, 2013). Neurochemistry may provide the vocabulary for interoceptive self-representation—distinct dimensions that multimodal integration circuits combine with world-state.

**Emotion as self-world integration**: Emotional experience may arise from integrating self-state (interoception, neurochemistry) with world-state (context, appraisal) in action-relevant format (Barrett, 2017; Damasio, 1994). Compositional neurochemistry provides the self-state vocabulary.

### 5.2 Clinical Implications

If neurochemistry provides compositional self-state:

**Comorbidity explained**: Obesity and addiction often co-occur (Volkow et al., 2013). If both involve dysregulated appetitive intensity, a single factor produces multiple presentations depending on context.

**Cross-domain treatment effects expected**: GLP-1 agonists for obesity affecting alcohol use is predicted, not surprising. Other cross-domain effects (SSRIs affecting both mood and GI function) are similarly predicted.

**Side effects are compositional consequences**: Reducing a factor reduces ALL contexts using that factor. GLP-1-related anhedonia (reduced wanting for healthy activities) is a feature, not a bug—the cost of modulating a compositional factor.

### 5.3 The Alternative: Compositional Language for Shared Mechanisms?

We must be honest: the compositional framing might add appealing language without adding explanatory power.

**What compositional adds**:

- Predictions about transfer structure, dissociation, novel generalization
- Framework for understanding which effects should and shouldn’t co-occur
- Connection to cognitive science research on compositionality

**What compositional might just be**:

- Sophisticated redescription of “these systems overlap”
- Theoretical overhead that collapses into simpler accounts

**Resolution**: Empirical. If the specific predictions (dissociations, proportional transfer, novel generalization) hold, compositionality earns its overhead. If effects are idiosyncratic, simpler accounts suffice.

## 6. Predictions and Falsification

### 6.1 Specific Predictions

**Prediction 1**: GLP-1 agonists should reduce appetitive states across domains proportionally, including for novel rewards never experienced during treatment.

**Prediction 2**: GLP-1 effects should dissociate from effort-willingness. Wanting reduced; effort preserved.

**Prediction 3**: Cross-domain effect sizes should be systematically related (transfer structure), not idiosyncratic.

**Prediction 4**: Domain-general anhedonia should emerge as a predicted side effect—reduced wanting across healthy and unhealthy appetitive states.

### 6.2 Falsification Criteria

The compositional framework would be challenged by:

1. **Idiosyncratic cross-domain effects**: No systematic relationship between effect sizes
1. **No novel reward generalization**: Effects limited to trained/targeted rewards
1. **No dissociations**: Every modulation affects all dimensions proportionally
1. **GLP-1 effects fully explained by DA modulation**: No wanting/effort dissociation

### 6.3 Evidence Levels

|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|Neurochemical systems show coordinated central-peripheral effects|Established                        |

|These signals combine compositionally with world-state           |Hypothesis                         |

## 7. Conclusion

Neurochemical systems show a striking pattern of coordinated central-peripheral effects. We’ve proposed that this reflects compositional self-state abstraction: distinct neurochemical dimensions that combine with world-state to produce context-appropriate behavior.

GLP-1 agonists provide a current test case. Their unexpected effects on alcohol and compulsive behaviors are consistent with compositional organization—modulating “appetitive intensity” affects all contexts using that factor. But we’ve acknowledged substantial uncertainty:

- GLP-1 effects might be entirely dopamine-mediated
- “Compositional” might just redescribe “shared mechanism”
- The formal precision of compositional semantics is absent here

**What would confirm the framework**: Systematic transfer structure (proportional effects across domains), novel reward generalization, and dissociations between factors (GLP-1 affecting wanting while sparing effort).

**What would disconfirm it**: Idiosyncratic effects, no novel generalization, no dissociations.

**The broader stakes**: How intelligent systems represent internal state matters for understanding flexible, generalizable behavior. If neurochemistry provides compositional self-state—reusable dimensions that combine with context—this explains why drugs developed for one condition affect others, why psychiatric conditions cluster, and why embodied agents have the behavioral flexibility they do.

For now, this is a framework for generating hypotheses and designing tests. The compositional interpretation earns its keep only if its predictions are confirmed.

## Outstanding Questions

1. What combination rules govern how self-state factors integrate with world-state? Can these be formalized?
1. Are there additional self-state factors beyond those identified? What’s the dimensionality of self-state representation?
1. How do factor interactions (GLP-1 modulating DA) relate to factor distinctness? Can interacting signals still be compositionally distinct?
1. What neural architecture implements self-world composition? Multimodal integration in insula, OFC, ACC?
1. How does compositional self-state relate to conscious self-experience? Is awareness of self-state required for compositional integration?
