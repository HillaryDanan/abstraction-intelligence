## Abstract

The conceptual division between “mental” and “physical” health reflects a Cartesian inheritance that modern neuroscience increasingly reveals as empirically untenable. This review examines the major neurochemical systems—serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis—demonstrating that each operates as an integrated viability-regulation system spanning brain and body rather than as a “brain chemical” with incidental peripheral effects. Serotonin serves as the primary exemplar: approximately 95% of the body’s serotonin resides in the gastrointestinal system, where it regulates motility, secretion, and satiation, while centrally it modulates mood, anxiety, and behavioral inhibition. This is not coincidence but functional integration—serotonin coordinates metabolic state with behavioral state because both serve organismal viability. We extend this analysis across neurochemical systems, showing convergent evidence for the thesis that neurochemistry implements **embodied viability regulation**: the continuous, predictive management of the organism’s relationship with its environment. This framework has immediate clinical implications, explaining why “physical” interventions (exercise, diet, sleep) affect “mental” health and vice versa, and why treatment approaches that honor mind-body integration show superior outcomes. We propose that the mental/physical distinction is not merely incomplete but actively misleading—a category error that impedes both scientific understanding and clinical practice.

## 1. Introduction: The Problem of Dualism in Neuroscience

### 1.1 The Cartesian Inheritance

Despite three centuries of post-Cartesian philosophy and decades of neuroscience, clinical practice and lay understanding remain organized around a fundamental division: mental versus physical, psychiatric versus medical, brain versus body. This division is so deeply embedded that it structures medical specialties, insurance reimbursement, research funding, and the phenomenology of illness itself—patients report “physical” symptoms to one type of doctor and “mental” symptoms to another.

Yet the neuroscience of the past three decades has progressively undermined this division. The same molecules that regulate mood regulate digestion. The same systems that control movement control motivation. The immune system communicates with the brain; the brain regulates immune function. “Stress” is simultaneously a psychological state and a physiological cascade with measurable effects on every organ system.

### 1.2 The Central Thesis

This review advances a specific claim: **major neurochemical systems are not “brain chemicals” with peripheral side effects but integrated viability-regulation systems that span brain and body by functional necessity.**

We define **viability regulation** as the continuous process by which an organism maintains the conditions necessary for its survival and reproduction. This includes:

- **Metabolic regulation**: Energy intake, storage, and expenditure
- **Defensive regulation**: Threat detection, immune activation, tissue repair
- **Behavioral regulation**: Action selection to acquire resources and avoid harm
- **Social regulation**: Coordination with conspecifics for mutual benefit

The traditional view holds that the brain “controls” the body and that neurochemicals mediate this control. We propose an alternative: brain and body are components of a single integrated system, and neurochemical systems coordinate this integration. The distinction between “central” and “peripheral” function is anatomical convenience, not functional reality.

### 1.3 Scope and Structure

We examine five major neurochemical systems:

1. **Serotonin (5-HT)**: The primary exemplar, demonstrating gut-brain integration
1. **Dopamine (DA)**: Reward, movement, and motivated action
1. **Norepinephrine (NE)**: Arousal, attention, and stress mobilization
1. **Acetylcholine (ACh)**: Memory, muscle control, and autonomtic balance
1. **The HPA axis and cortisol**: The canonical stress-response system

For each system, we review:

- Anatomical distribution (central and peripheral)
- Functional roles across domains
- Evidence for integration rather than separation
- Clinical implications

We then synthesize these findings into a theoretical framework connecting neurochemistry to embodied cognition and embedded agency.

### 1.4 Epistemic Status

Throughout this review, we distinguish:

- **Established**: Findings replicated across multiple peer-reviewed studies with broad consensus
- **Well-supported**: Findings with substantial evidence but ongoing refinement
- **Hypothesis**: Theoretical proposals consistent with evidence but requiring further testing
- **Framework**: Interpretive structures that organize findings but are not directly falsifiable

The empirical findings reviewed are established or well-supported. The integrative framework is hypothesis-level, offered as a more parsimonious interpretation of existing data than the traditional mental/physical division.

## 2. Serotonin: The Paradigm Case of Mind-Body Integration

### 2.1 Distribution: A “Brain Chemical” That Lives in the Gut

The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system provides the most striking demonstration of mind-body integration because its distribution defies the “brain chemical” narrative so completely.

**Established finding**: Approximately 95% of the body’s serotonin is located in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in enterochromaffin cells of the gut mucosa and in enteric neurons (Gershon & Tack, 2007; Berger et al., 2009). Only ~5% resides in the central nervous system, primarily in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem.

This distribution is not an evolutionary accident or vestigial arrangement. Serotonin appeared early in evolution, predating the nervous system itself, and likely originated as a signaling molecule in the gut (Azmitia, 2001). The “brain” serotonin system is, evolutionarily speaking, an extension of the gut system—not the reverse.

### 2.2 Peripheral Functions: Gut Motility, Secretion, and Satiation

In the gastrointestinal system, serotonin serves multiple established functions:

**Motility regulation**: Serotonin released from enterochromaffin cells activates 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors on enteric neurons, initiating peristalsis and the migrating motor complex (Gershon, 2013). Approximately 90% of gut motility is regulated by the enteric nervous system, operating largely independently of central control but using serotonin as a primary signaling molecule.

**Secretion**: Serotonin modulates fluid secretion in the gut, affecting both absorption and secretion processes (Mawe & Hoffman, 2013).

**Satiation signaling**: Serotonin contributes to satiation—the feeling of having eaten enough. Peripheral 5-HT acts on vagal afferents to signal fullness to the brain (Hayes & Bhavani, 2015). This is not separate from serotonin’s central satiety effects; it is the peripheral arm of an integrated system.

**Nausea and vomiting**: The 5-HT3 receptor mediates the nausea response, explaining why serotonergic drugs commonly produce GI side effects and why 5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron) are effective antiemetics (Gershon, 2013).

### 2.3 Central Functions: Mood, Anxiety, and Behavioral Inhibition

The central serotonin system, originating in the raphe nuclei and projecting widely throughout the brain, modulates:

**Mood and affect**: Low serotonergic function is associated with depression, though the relationship is more complex than the simplistic “chemical imbalance” narrative suggests (Cowen & Browning, 2015). SSRIs increase synaptic serotonin availability and, over weeks, produce antidepressant effects in a significant subset of patients.

**Anxiety**: Serotonin modulates anxiety-related circuits, with complex effects depending on receptor subtype and brain region (Lowry et al., 2005). SSRIs are effective anxiolytics, often more reliably than as antidepressants.

**Behavioral inhibition**: Serotonin promotes impulse control and the inhibition of prepotent responses. Low serotonin is associated with impulsivity and aggression (Coccaro et al., 2015).

**Sleep-wake regulation**: Serotonin is involved in sleep regulation, with raphe neurons showing state-dependent firing patterns (Monti, 2011).

### 2.4 Integration: Why Gut and Brain Share a Signaling System

The traditional interpretation views gut serotonin and brain serotonin as separate systems that happen to use the same molecule. We propose the opposite: **they are one system with distributed implementation because their functions are inherently linked.**

Consider the computational problem facing any organism that must:

1. Acquire energy through feeding
1. Regulate behavioral activity based on energy state
1. Coordinate activity with metabolic readiness

A system that signals satiation (gut) *should* be linked to a system that modulates behavioral activation (brain). When the organism is fed, it should feel satisfied and reduce food-seeking; when hungry, it should feel motivated and increase food-seeking. Serotonin coordinates both because both are aspects of a single regulatory challenge.

**Hypothesis**: Serotonin is a **viability-state signal** that coordinates metabolic status with behavioral state. High serotonergic tone signals “resources adequate, conserve and digest.” Low serotonergic tone signals “resources needed, activate and seek.”

This explains:

- Why SSRIs reduce appetite (satiation signaling enhanced)
- Why SSRIs reduce anxiety (threat-mobilization reduced when resources adequate)
- Why depression involves both mood symptoms and vegetative symptoms (appetite, sleep, energy)
- Why gut dysfunction and mood dysfunction co-occur at rates far exceeding chance

### 2.5 The Gut-Brain Axis: Bidirectional Communication

The gut-brain axis refers to bidirectional communication between the GI system and the CNS. Multiple pathways mediate this communication (Mayer, 2011; Cryan & Dinan, 2012):

**Vagal afferents**: The vagus nerve carries sensory information from gut to brain, including serotonin-mediated signals from enterochromaffin cells. Approximately 80% of vagal fibers are afferent (gut-to-brain), not efferent.

**Immune signaling**: Gut immune activation produces cytokines that affect brain function (see Section 6).

**Microbial metabolites**: Gut bacteria produce neuroactive compounds including serotonin precursors, short-chain fatty acids, and other molecules that affect brain function (Cryan & Dinan, 2012).

**Established finding**: Germ-free mice show altered anxiety-like behavior, altered stress responses, and altered neurochemistry compared to conventionally colonized mice (Sudo et al., 2004; Heijtz et al., 2011). Probiotic administration can affect anxiety and depression measures in both rodents and humans, though human evidence remains mixed and effect sizes modest (Reis et al., 2018).

### 2.6 Clinical Implications

The integrated view of serotonin has immediate clinical implications:

**GI side effects of SSRIs are not side effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, and appetite changes following SSRI initiation reflect the same mechanism as mood effects. They are not off-target effects but gut-level manifestations of altered serotonin signaling. They typically diminish as the system adapts, but their presence confirms systemic action.

**IBS and depression comorbidity**: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and depression co-occur at rates of 40-60%, far exceeding chance (Fond et al., 2014). This is not “psychosomatic” in the dismissive sense; it reflects shared reliance on a serotonergic system that regulates both.

**Diet affects mood**: Dietary tryptophan (serotonin precursor) availability affects central serotonin synthesis. Acute tryptophan depletion produces transient mood effects, particularly in vulnerable individuals (Ruhé et al., 2007).

## 3. Dopamine: Reward, Movement, and Motivated Action

### 3.1 Distribution and Pathways

The dopamine system comprises several distinct pathways with both central and peripheral functions:

**Central pathways** (established):

- **Mesolimbic pathway**: Ventral tegmental area (VTA) to nucleus accumbens; mediates reward and motivation
- **Mesocortical pathway**: VTA to prefrontal cortex; mediates executive function and working memory
- **Nigrostriatal pathway**: Substantia nigra to dorsal striatum; mediates movement initiation and control
- **Tuberoinfundibular pathway**: Hypothalamus to pituitary; regulates prolactin release

**Peripheral dopamine** (established but less emphasized):

- Renal dopamine regulates sodium excretion and blood pressure (Carey, 2001)
- GI dopamine modulates motility and secretion
- Immune cells express dopamine receptors and synthesize dopamine (Levite, 2016)

### 3.2 The Reward Prediction Error Framework

Contemporary understanding of mesolimbic dopamine centers on **reward prediction error** (Schultz, 1998; Schultz, 2015):

**Established finding**: Midbrain dopamine neurons fire in response to unexpected rewards and to cues predicting rewards. Critically, they fire *above baseline* when reward exceeds expectation, *at baseline* when reward matches expectation, and *below baseline* when expected reward is omitted.

This pattern suggests dopamine signals not reward itself but the *difference* between expected and received reward—a teaching signal for learning about the world’s reward structure.

**Well-supported**: This reward prediction error signal drives reinforcement learning, updating action values based on outcome feedback (Montague et al., 1996; Dayan & Balleine, 2002).

### 3.3 Movement and Motivation: An Integrated Function

The traditional division separates “motor” dopamine (nigrostriatal) from “reward” dopamine (mesolimbic). But this division obscures functional integration:

**Parkinson’s disease** involves both motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and motivational/mood symptoms (apathy, anhedonia, depression). These co-occur because the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems are not functionally independent—both mediate the translation of motivation into action (Mazzoni et al., 2007).

**Hypothesis**: Dopamine mediates the **vigor** of motivated action—how energetically an organism pursues goals. Movement and motivation are not separate functions but aspects of the same function: converting goals into action.

Support for this hypothesis comes from studies showing that dopamine depletion reduces not just motor ability but the *willingness* to exert effort for reward (Salamone et al., 2007). Animals with dopamine lesions can perform actions but choose not to when effort is required.

### 3.4 Peripheral Dopamine: Beyond the Brain

**Renal function**: Dopamine synthesized in renal tubular cells promotes sodium excretion and vasodilation. Dopamine infusion is used clinically to improve renal perfusion (Carey, 2001).

**Immune function**: Dopamine receptors are expressed on T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Dopamine modulates immune cell activation, migration, and cytokine release (Levite, 2016). The implications for neuropsychiatric illness are actively investigated.

**GI function**: Dopamine in the gut inhibits motility, opposing serotonin’s prokinetic effects. This creates a push-pull regulatory system for GI function.

### 3.5 Integration: Dopamine as Vigor-Regulation System

Across its functions, dopamine can be understood as regulating **how energetically the organism pursues goals**:

- Centrally: willingness to exert effort, movement initiation, action vigor
- Renally: mobilizing resources (sodium balance, blood pressure) for action
- Immunologically: modulating resource allocation between defense and other functions

**Hypothesis**: Dopamine coordinates the organism’s investment in goal pursuit. High dopaminergic tone signals “invest effort—goal is achievable and valuable.” Low dopaminergic tone signals “conserve effort—goal is unachievable or not worth the cost.”

This explains:

- Why dopamine is involved in both movement and motivation (both are aspects of goal pursuit)
- Why Parkinson’s produces both motor and motivational symptoms
- Why depression involves anhedonia and psychomotor slowing (reduced investment in goal pursuit)
- Why stimulants (dopamine agonists) increase both motor activity and goal-directed behavior

## 4. Norepinephrine: Arousal, Attention, and the Stress Response

### 4.1 Central and Peripheral Distribution

Norepinephrine (NE) provides perhaps the clearest example of an integrated stress-response system:

**Central**: The locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem sends noradrenergic projections throughout the cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum. LC neurons fire in response to salient stimuli and modulate arousal, attention, and memory consolidation (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005).

**Peripheral**: The sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine at target organs throughout the body, producing the classic “fight-or-flight” response: increased heart rate, bronchodilation, vasoconstriction in non-essential vascular beds, vasodilation in skeletal muscle, glycogenolysis, and pupil dilation.

**Adrenal**: The adrenal medulla releases both norepinephrine and epinephrine into the bloodstream, producing systemic effects.

### 4.2 The Stress Response as Integrated System

When an organism encounters a threat, the response is not “mental” or “physical” but integrated:

**Central effects**: Increased arousal, narrowed attention to threat-relevant stimuli, enhanced sensory processing, suppression of non-urgent cognitive processes, memory encoding for threat-relevant information.

**Peripheral effects**: Cardiovascular mobilization for action, respiratory enhancement, metabolic mobilization (glucose release), immune redistribution, suppression of digestive and reproductive functions.

**Established finding**: These responses are coordinated because they are mediated by a single integrated system—the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis working in concert with locus coeruleus activation. Threatening stimuli activate both simultaneously because both are required for effective response.

### 4.3 Clinical Implications

**PTSD**: Noradrenergic hyperactivation contributes to PTSD symptoms—hyperarousal, exaggerated startle, intrusive memories (which are consolidated under high noradrenergic tone). Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, reduces PTSD-related nightmares (Raskind et al., 2013).

**Anxiety disorders**: Chronic noradrenergic activation contributes to generalized anxiety. Physical symptoms (racing heart, sweating, tremor) and psychological symptoms (worry, apprehension) are two manifestations of the same system activation.

**ADHD**: Norepinephrine modulates attention, and noradrenergic medications (atomoxetine) are effective ADHD treatments (Garnock-Jones & Keating, 2009).

### 4.4 Integration: Norepinephrine as Urgency-Mobilization System

**Hypothesis**: Norepinephrine signals **“act now—situation requires immediate response.”** It coordinates:

- Central: attention, arousal, memory encoding for urgent situations
- Peripheral: physiological mobilization for immediate action
- Both simultaneously because urgent situations require both cognitive and physiological readiness

The chronic activation of this system (chronic stress) produces both “mental” effects (anxiety, cognitive impairment) and “physical” effects (cardiovascular strain, immune dysregulation, metabolic disruption)—not as separate consequences but as manifestations of sustained activation of an integrated urgency-response system.

## 5. Acetylcholine: Memory, Muscle, and Autonomic Balance

### 5.1 Distribution: The Most Ubiquitous Neurotransmitter

Acetylcholine (ACh) demonstrates integration differently—it is the primary neurotransmitter at multiple critical interfaces:

**Neuromuscular junction**: ACh mediates all voluntary muscle contraction. Motor neurons release ACh onto nicotinic receptors on muscle fibers, producing contraction.

**Autonomic ganglia**: ACh is the neurotransmitter at all autonomic ganglia, both sympathetic and parasympathetic.

**Parasympathetic effectors**: Parasympathetic postganglionic neurons release ACh onto muscarinic receptors at target organs (heart, gut, glands).

**Central cholinergic systems**: Basal forebrain nuclei project to cortex and hippocampus, modulating attention, learning, and memory (Hasselmo & Sarter, 2011).

### 5.2 Central Functions: Attention and Memory

**Established finding**: Central cholinergic projections from basal forebrain modulate attention and memory encoding. Cholinergic lesions impair learning; cholinergic enhancement improves attention.

**Alzheimer’s disease**: Degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons is an early and consistent feature of Alzheimer’s disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) provide modest symptomatic benefit by enhancing remaining cholinergic function (Hampel et al., 2018).

### 5.3 Peripheral Functions: Movement and Rest-and-Digest

**Neuromuscular**: All voluntary movement requires cholinergic transmission. Myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease targeting nicotinic receptors, produces profound weakness.

**Parasympathetic**: The parasympathetic system (“rest-and-digest”) uses ACh to promote digestion, slow heart rate, and facilitate recuperative processes.

### 5.4 Integration: Cholinergic Systems Coordinate Action with Learning

**Hypothesis**: Acetylcholine coordinates **action with learning about action**:

- Peripherally: executing movements
- Centrally: encoding memory of what actions were taken and their consequences

This makes functional sense. An organism that acts must also learn from the outcomes of its actions. The cholinergic system coordinates action execution (peripheral) with action encoding (central).

The parasympathetic role adds another dimension: ACh promotes not only memory encoding but the “rest-and-digest” state that consolidates memory (sleep, low-arousal periods).

## 6. The HPA Axis and Cortisol: Chronic Stress and Systemic Regulation

### 6.1 The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis

While the SAM axis (norepinephrine/epinephrine) mediates rapid stress responses, the HPA axis mediates slower, sustained responses:

**Mechanism** (established):

1. Hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
1. Pituitary release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
1. Adrenal cortex release of cortisol (glucocorticoid)
1. Negative feedback at hypothalamus and pituitary

**Time course**: HPA activation occurs over minutes to hours, in contrast to SAM activation over seconds to minutes.

### 6.2 Cortisol Functions: Metabolic, Immune, Cognitive

Cortisol has effects across virtually every organ system:

**Metabolic**: Promotes gluconeogenesis, protein catabolism, and fat redistribution. Mobilizes energy for sustained challenge.

**Immune**: Complex effects—acute cortisol is immunomodulatory; chronic elevation is immunosuppressive. Cortisol redirects immune resources and reduces inflammation (Silverman & Sternberg, 2012).

**Cognitive**: Moderate cortisol enhances memory consolidation for emotionally significant events; chronic elevation impairs hippocampal function and produces memory deficits (Lupien et al., 2007).

**Cardiovascular**: Contributes to blood pressure regulation; chronic elevation promotes hypertension and atherosclerosis.

### 6.3 Chronic Stress: When Adaptation Becomes Damage

The stress response evolved for acute challenges—predator encounters, injuries, short-term resource scarcity. Chronic activation produces pathology:

**Allostatic load**: McEwen’s concept of “allostatic load” captures the cumulative wear-and-tear from chronic stress-response activation (McEwen, 1998). The same systems that protect acutely cause damage chronically.

**Established consequences of chronic HPA activation**:

- Hippocampal atrophy and memory impairment (Lupien et al., 2009)
- Increased visceral fat deposition (metabolic syndrome)
- Immune dysregulation and increased inflammation
- Cardiovascular damage
- Mood dysregulation (depression, anxiety)

### 6.4 Integration: The HPA Axis as Sustained-Challenge System

**Hypothesis**: The HPA axis coordinates the organism’s response to **sustained challenges that require metabolic redistribution**:

- Mobilizing energy stores
- Suppressing non-essential functions (reproduction, growth, immune elaboration)
- Enhancing memory for challenge-relevant information
- Preparing for prolonged resource scarcity

The “mental” and “physical” effects of chronic stress are not separate—they are manifestations of sustained activation of a system designed for temporary activation.

-----

## 7. Inflammation and the Immune-Brain Interface

### 7.1 Cytokines Affect Brain Function

The immune system communicates with the brain via cytokines—signaling molecules that coordinate immune responses but also affect neural function:

**Established finding**: Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) produce “sickness behavior”: fatigue, anhedonia, social withdrawal, anorexia, sleep alterations (Dantzer et al., 2008). These effects are not side effects of being sick—they are adaptive responses that redirect resources toward immune function.

### 7.2 Inflammation in Depression

**Well-supported**: A subset of depressed patients shows elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α). Meta-analyses confirm the association, though effect sizes are moderate and not all depressed patients show elevation (Howren et al., 2009; Dowlati et al., 2010).

**Inflammatory challenge → depressive symptoms**: Administration of inflammatory stimuli (endotoxin, interferon-α) produces depressive symptoms in a significant subset of recipients (Reichenberg et al., 2001; Capuron & Miller, 2011).

**Anti-inflammatory → antidepressant**: Anti-inflammatory treatments show antidepressant effects in subgroups, particularly those with elevated baseline inflammation (Raison et al., 2013; Köhler et al., 2014).

### 7.3 Integration: The Immune System as Viability-Threat Detector

**Hypothesis**: The immune system is a **distributed threat-detection system** that communicates with the brain to coordinate organismal response to infection, injury, and other viability threats.

“Sickness behavior” is not a malfunction—it is adaptive redirection of resources:

- Fatigue → energy conservation for immune function
- Anhedonia → reduced exploration and risk-taking during vulnerability
- Social withdrawal → reduced disease transmission, reduced exposure to threats
- Fever → enhanced immune function

Depression may represent, in some cases, inappropriate or chronic activation of this system—“sickness behavior without infection” (Miller & Raison, 2016).

## 8. Theoretical Integration: Neurochemistry as Embodied Viability Regulation

### 8.1 The Common Pattern

Across the systems reviewed, a common pattern emerges:

|System        |Central Function           |Peripheral Function              |Integrated Function                          |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|Serotonin     |Mood, behavioral inhibition|Gut motility, satiation          |Metabolic-state/behavioral-state coordination|
|Dopamine      |Motivation, effort         |Renal function, immune modulation|Vigor of goal pursuit                        |
|Norepinephrine|Arousal, attention         |Sympathetic activation           |Urgent-situation mobilization                |
|Acetylcholine |Memory, attention          |Movement, rest-and-digest        |Action/learning coordination                 |
|HPA/Cortisol  |Memory, mood               |Metabolism, immune               |Sustained-challenge response                 |
|Cytokines     |Sickness behavior          |Immune coordination              |Viability-threat response                    |

### 8.2 The Thesis: Viability Regulation Is Inherently Mind-Body

**Core thesis**: These neurochemical systems implement **viability regulation**—the continuous process of maintaining the conditions necessary for survival and reproduction. Viability regulation is inherently mind-body because:

1. **Viability threats are physical and behavioral**: A predator threatens both body (if caught) and requires behavioral response (escape). Energy depletion is both metabolic and requires behavioral response (feeding). Separating “physical” from “mental” would compromise effective response.
1. **Effective response requires coordination**: Escaping a predator requires both physiological mobilization (cardiovascular, respiratory) and cognitive mobilization (attention, action selection). These must be coordinated because they serve the same function.
1. **Resource allocation is unified**: The organism has finite resources to allocate among competing demands (defense, growth, reproduction, activity, rest). Neurochemical systems coordinate this allocation. Depression, for example, may represent a resource-conservation mode that reduces investment in exploration, social engagement, and goal pursuit (Nesse, 2000).

### 8.3 Relation to Embedded Agency

This thesis extends the framework developed in previous papers (Danan, 2025e; Danan, 2025f):

**Paper 5** argued that the self/world distinction is foundational for embedded agents. The “self” for biological agents is the body—the physical substrate whose viability must be maintained.

**Paper 6** argued that phenomenal experience is the format of embedded information—how self-world relations are represented for an agent that must act.

The present paper adds: **Neurochemical systems are how biological agents implement viability regulation.** They are not “brain chemicals” that also happen to affect the body; they are viability-regulation systems that span brain and body because viability is a property of the whole organism, not just the brain.

### 8.4 The Allostasis Framework

Sterling and Eyer (1988) introduced **allostasis**—“stability through change”—as an alternative to homeostasis. Whereas homeostasis implies defending fixed set-points, allostasis implies predictively adjusting parameters based on anticipated demands.

The brain is the primary organ of allostasis: it predicts upcoming demands and coordinates bodily systems accordingly (Sterling, 2012). Waking before the alarm, preparing for a stressor before it arrives, mobilizing resources in anticipation of action—these are allostatic processes mediated by the neurochemical systems reviewed here.

**Allostatic regulation is inherently mind-body**: The brain predicts; the body prepares. They are components of a single predictive regulatory system.

-----

## 9. Clinical Implications

### 9.1 “Physical” and “Mental” Treatments Converge

If neurochemical systems are integrated viability-regulation systems, interventions targeting one domain should affect the other:

**Exercise as antidepressant**: Physical exercise produces antidepressant effects comparable to medication in some meta-analyses (Kvam et al., 2016). This is not surprising if depression involves dysregulation of systems that coordinate behavioral and metabolic state. Exercise directly engages these systems.

**Diet and mental health**: Dietary patterns (Mediterranean diet, anti-inflammatory diets) are associated with reduced depression risk (Lassale et al., 2019). This follows if mood regulation and metabolic regulation share substrate.

**Sleep and mental health**: Sleep deprivation produces mood disturbance; sleep interventions improve depression (Krystal et al., 2008). Sleep is when allostatic recalibration occurs; disrupting it disrupts the whole system.

**Inflammation and depression**: Anti-inflammatory treatments show antidepressant effects in inflammatory subgroups (Köhler et al., 2014). This follows if depression is, in some cases, sickness behavior inappropriately activated.

### 9.2 Side Effects Are System Effects

When SSRIs produce nausea, this is not a “side effect”—it is the gut manifestation of altered serotonin signaling. When antipsychotics produce metabolic syndrome, this reflects dopamine’s role in metabolic regulation, not an off-target effect. When chronic stress produces both anxiety and cardiovascular disease, these are not separate consequences but manifestations of sustained activation of an integrated system.

**Clinical implication**: Side effects are information about system-wide effects. Attending to them reveals how the system is responding, not just how the brain is responding.

### 9.3 Integrated Treatment Approaches

**Hypothesis**: Treatment approaches that honor mind-body integration should show superior outcomes.

Preliminary evidence supports this:

- Combined exercise and psychotherapy outperforms either alone for depression (Blumenthal et al., 2007)
- Mind-body interventions (yoga, meditation) show effects on both mood and physiological measures (Pascoe et al., 2017)
- Collaborative care models integrating mental and physical health show improved outcomes (Archer et al., 2012)

The evidence base is growing but not yet definitive. Integrated approaches face practical and systemic barriers (insurance, specialization, training) that impede rigorous testing.

## 10. Limitations and Open Questions

### 10.1 Complexity and Oversimplification

This review emphasizes integration but risks oversimplifying genuinely complex systems. Each neurochemical system has multiple receptor subtypes with different, sometimes opposing functions. Regional specificity matters—serotonin in one brain region may have different effects than serotonin in another. The integration thesis does not negate this complexity; it provides a framework for understanding why the complexity exists (fine-tuned viability regulation requires nuanced signaling).

### 10.2 Individual Variation

Not all individuals respond identically to neurochemical manipulations. Genetics, developmental history, current state, and stochastic factors all contribute to individual variation. The framework explains what systems are doing on average; predicting individual responses requires additional precision.

### 10.3 The Hard Problems Remain

This framework does not solve the hard problems of consciousness or explain why viability regulation *feels like something*. It is consistent with the approach taken in Paper 6 (experience is the format of embedded information), but integrating neurochemistry with phenomenology remains an open challenge.

### 10.4 Falsifiability

The integrative framework is more parsimonious than the mental/physical division but not straightforwardly falsifiable. It would be challenged by:

- Neurochemical systems with genuinely separate central and peripheral functions (no evidence of coordination)
- “Mental” interventions with no physiological correlates or vice versa
- Successful treatments that target only one domain with no spillover to the other

Current evidence does not support these challenges, but the framework should be held tentatively.

-----

## 11. Conclusion

The Cartesian division between mind and body, though intuitive and deeply embedded in clinical practice, is not supported by neuroscientific evidence. The major neurochemical systems—serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and cortisol—are not “brain chemicals” with incidental peripheral effects but integrated viability-regulation systems spanning brain and body.

Serotonin coordinates metabolic state with behavioral state. Dopamine coordinates motivation with physiological investment in action. Norepinephrine coordinates cognitive arousal with physiological mobilization. The HPA axis coordinates cognitive-emotional responses to stress with metabolic redistribution. In each case, “central” and “peripheral” functions serve a unified purpose: maintaining the conditions necessary for organismal viability.

This framework has immediate implications:

**For science**: Mind-body integration is not a curiosity or caveat—it is the default organization of biological systems. Research programs that study “mental” and “physical” health separately miss the integration that defines how these systems work.

**For clinical practice**: “Physical” and “mental” symptoms are often manifestations of the same underlying system state. Treatment approaches that honor integration—addressing sleep, exercise, diet, stress, relationships, and neurochemistry together—may prove more effective than approaches that separate domains.

**For patients**: The division between “mental” and “physical” illness contributes to stigma (mental illness is seen as less “real”) and to fragmented care. Understanding that anxiety involves the same systems as cardiovascular stress, that depression involves the same systems as metabolic regulation, may help patients and providers take integrated approaches.

The mind-body problem, as a philosophical puzzle, remains unsolved. But the mind-body division, as an assumption organizing science and medicine, should be abandoned. The evidence points toward integration.
