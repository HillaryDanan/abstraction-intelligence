## Abstract

Social emotions—shame, guilt, pride, jealousy, envy, gratitude, contempt—have resisted integration into general theories of emotion. We propose that social emotions are not a special category but a natural scaling of the embedded self-world framework: **when the world contains other agents, self-world integration must include self-other relations**. Other agents are world-elements that possess their own self-world boundaries, goals, and capacities—and whose behavior toward the self depends on their evaluation of the self. Social emotions are the action-relevant format of multi-agent self-world information, guiding decisions about cooperation, competition, affiliation, and reputation. This framing reveals deep continuity across scales: atoms interact based on electron configurations; neurons based on activation states; cells based on chemical signals; organisms based on social emotions. At each level, units in a system use information from other units to guide behavior under resource constraints. Social emotions are how embedded biological agents navigate the multi-agent problem. This framework generates predictions about the computational structure of social emotions, their relationship to reputation and cooperation, and their implementation in neural systems that represent both self-state and other-state.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem of Social Emotions

Basic emotions—fear, anger, joy, sadness, disgust—have clear self-world structure: threat to self, obstacle to self, benefit to self. Paper 8 (Danan, 2025h) argued that emotions are integrated self-world information formatted for action.

But social emotions complicate this picture:

- **Shame:** I feel bad because others evaluate me negatively
- **Guilt:** I feel bad because I harmed another
- **Pride:** I feel good because others evaluate me positively, or I met my own standards
- **Jealousy:** I feel threatened because a rival may take what’s mine
- **Envy:** I feel bad because another has what I lack
- **Gratitude:** I feel good because another helped me
- **Contempt:** I evaluate another as beneath consideration

These emotions involve *other agents*. The “world” is not just physical environment but social environment—populated by entities that have their own selves, goals, and evaluations.

### 1.2 The Proposal

**Core thesis:** Social emotions are not a special category. They are the same self-world integration (Paper 8), applied to environments containing multiple agents.

When the world contains other selves:

- World-state includes other-state (their goals, capacities, evaluations)
- Self-world relation includes self-other relation
- Action possibilities include social actions (cooperate, compete, affiliate, punish, signal)
- Viability depends on social outcomes (reputation, alliances, access to socially-mediated resources)

Social emotions are the action-relevant format of this multi-agent information.

### 1.3 The Scaling Insight

This is not unique to human psychology. It is a general principle:

**Atoms:** Interact based on electron configurations. “Behavior” (bonding, repelling) depends on own state and other-state.

**Neurons:** Fire based on input from other neurons. Behavior depends on own threshold and others’ activation.

**Cells:** Communicate via chemical signals. Behavior depends on own receptors and others’ secretions.

**Organisms:** Navigate social environments. Behavior depends on own state and others’ states, goals, evaluations.

**Societies:** Institutions and norms emerge from multi-agent interaction under resource constraints.

At each scale, units use information from other units to guide behavior. Social emotions are the format this takes for embedded biological agents with sufficient complexity.

### 1.4 Epistemic Status

- **Established:** Social emotion phenomena; game-theoretic frameworks for cooperation; social neuroscience findings
- **Theoretical:** The scaling argument; integration with self-world framework
- **Hypothesis:** Specific predictions about social emotion computation and neural implementation

## 2. Background: Social Emotions in Existing Frameworks

### 2.1 Evolutionary Approaches

Evolutionary psychology frames social emotions as adaptations for navigating ancestral social environments (Cosmides & Tooby, 2000; Tooby & Cosmides, 1990).

**Guilt** motivates reparation after harming valuable social partners, maintaining cooperative relationships (Baumeister et al., 1994).

**Shame** motivates conformity to group norms and signals submission after norm violation, reducing punishment (Fessler, 2007; Sznycer et al., 2016).

**Gratitude** motivates reciprocation, sustaining cooperative exchange (McCullough et al., 2001).

**Envy** motivates competition for status and resources (Hill & Buss, 2008).

**Established finding:** Social emotions show cross-cultural universality in core features while varying in elicitors and expression norms (Tracy & Robins, 2007; Sznycer et al., 2017). This suggests evolved function with cultural tuning.

### 2.2 Appraisal Approaches

Appraisal theories propose that social emotions arise from evaluations along social dimensions (Scherer, 2001; Ellsworth & Scherer, 2003):

- **Agency:** Did self or other cause the outcome?
- **Norm compatibility:** Does the situation violate social/moral norms?
- **Other’s evaluation:** How do others evaluate me?
- **Relative position:** How do I compare to others?

Social emotions involve appraisals specifically about self-other relations and social standing.

### 2.3 Self-Conscious Emotions

Tracy and Robins (2004, 2007) propose that pride, shame, and guilt are “self-conscious emotions” requiring:

1. Self-awareness (representing oneself as object)
1. Self-representations (identity, standards, goals)
1. Self-evaluative comparisons (actual self vs. ideal self)

These emotions emerge developmentally after basic emotions, coinciding with self-recognition and self-concept development (Lewis, 2000).

**Established finding:** Self-conscious emotions correlate with measures of self-awareness and self-reflection. Individuals with impaired self-representation show altered self-conscious emotional experience (Morin, 2011; Sturm et al., 2013).

### 2.4 The Integration Gap

Existing frameworks describe social emotions accurately but do not fully explain:

- Why social emotions feel like emotions (not just social cognition)
- How social emotions connect to basic emotions
- Why social information produces embodied, action-urging states

We propose the self-world framework provides this integration.

## 3. The Multi-Agent Extension

### 3.1 Other Agents as Special World-Elements

When the world contains other agents, world-modeling becomes more complex.

**Non-agent world elements** (rocks, weather, food sources):

- Have states that affect self
- Behavior is predictable from physical properties
- Do not model the self

**Agent world elements** (other organisms, especially conspecifics):

- Have states that affect self
- Behavior depends on their goals, beliefs, evaluations
- May model the self and adjust behavior based on that model

This is the critical difference: other agents can *represent you* and *act based on that representation*.

### 3.2 The Recursive Structure

Social cognition involves recursive modeling (Premack & Woodruff, 1978; Frith & Frith, 2006):

- Level 0: I have states
- Level 1: I represent others’ states
- Level 2: I represent others’ representations of my states
- Level 3: I represent others’ representations of my representations of their states
- …

Social emotions recruit this recursive structure. Shame involves representing that others represent me negatively. Pride involves representing that others represent me positively. Guilt involves representing harm to another’s states.

**Established finding:** Social emotions activate brain regions associated with mentalizing and self-referential processing (Takahashi et al., 2004; Zahn et al., 2009; Bastin et al., 2016). This neural overlap suggests social emotions involve integrating self-representation with other-representation.

### 3.3 Self-World Becomes Self-Others-World

For social agents, the self-world relation becomes:

**Self-state:** My current condition (as before)

**World-state:** Physical environment (as before) + social environment:

- Others’ states (goals, resources, alliances)
- Others’ evaluations of me
- Social norms and expectations
- My reputation (others’ aggregated representations of me)

**Self-world relation:** How does world-state (including social world) affect my viability?

**Action possibilities:** Physical actions + social actions:

- Cooperate / defect
- Affiliate / distance
- Signal / conceal
- Conform / deviate
- Punish / forgive

**Viability:** Now includes social viability:

- Access to socially-mediated resources
- Protection from group-based threats
- Mating opportunities
- Coalition support

### 3.4 Why Social Information Produces Emotion

Why does knowing that others evaluate you negatively produce an *embodied, action-urging state* rather than just a belief?

**Answer from the framework:** Because others’ evaluations predict viability consequences.

In ancestral environments (and often today):

- Negative social evaluation → exclusion → reduced resource access, protection, mating → reduced survival and reproduction
- Positive social evaluation → inclusion → increased resource access, protection, mating → increased survival and reproduction

The body “knows” this. Negative social evaluation is processed as threat to viability—producing the embodied, urgent, action-preparing states characteristic of emotion.

**Established finding:** Social exclusion activates neural regions overlapping with physical pain processing (Eisenberger et al., 2003; Kross et al., 2011). Social rejection produces physiological stress responses similar to physical threats (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). The brain treats social threats as genuine threats.

## 4. Specific Social Emotions as Self-Other-World Integration

### 4.1 Shame: Others Evaluate Me Negatively

**Shame** arises when:

- **Self-state:** I have acted or been revealed in a way that violates norms
- **Other-state:** Others are evaluating me negatively (or would if they knew)
- **Self-other relation:** Their negative evaluation predicts social exclusion/devaluation
- **Viability prediction:** Social viability is threatened
- **Action possibilities:** Hide, withdraw, submit, repair, prevent future exposure

**Format:** Shame feels like shrinking, wanting to disappear, urge to hide. This IS the action-relevant format: reduce social exposure to limit damage.

**Established finding:** Shame involves characteristic nonverbal display—shoulders slumped, gaze averted, body contracted (Tracy & Matsumoto, 2008). This “submissive” display may function to signal acceptance of lower status, reducing aggression from evaluators (Keltner & Harker, 1998).

**Distinction from guilt:** Shame focuses on global self (“I am bad”); guilt focuses on specific action (“I did a bad thing”). This maps to different viability implications: shame threatens core social standing; guilt threatens specific relationships and requires specific repair (Tangney & Dearing, 2002).

### 4.2 Guilt: I Have Harmed Another

**Guilt** arises when:

- **Self-state:** I have caused harm to another’s interests
- **Other-state:** Another has been damaged by my action
- **Self-other relation:** My action violated the cooperative relationship
- **Viability prediction:** Valuable social relationship is threatened
- **Action possibilities:** Apologize, repair, compensate, prevent recurrence

**Format:** Guilt feels like an urge to make amends, preoccupation with the harm caused, tension until repair is made. This IS the action-relevant format: motivate reparative action.

**Established finding:** Guilt motivates prosocial behavior toward the harmed party specifically (Baumeister et al., 1994). It is relationship-specific, unlike shame which is more global (Tangney et al., 2007).

### 4.3 Pride: I Am Evaluated Positively / I Met Standards

**Pride** arises when:

- **Self-state:** I have achieved something or demonstrated valued qualities
- **Other-state:** Others recognize and positively evaluate my achievement (or I anticipate they would)
- **Self-other relation:** Positive evaluation predicts enhanced social standing
- **Viability prediction:** Social viability is enhanced
- **Action possibilities:** Display, capitalize, set higher goals, maintain status

**Format:** Pride feels expansive—head high, chest out, desire to be seen. This IS the action-relevant format: signal value to the social group.

**Established finding:** Pride has a recognizable cross-cultural expression—expanded posture, head tilted back, arms raised or hands on hips (Tracy & Robins, 2004, 2007). This display signals high status and is recognized across cultures, including isolated populations (Tracy & Robins, 2008).

**Two types:** “Authentic” pride (achievement-based) and “hubristic” pride (dominance-based) may have different action tendencies—authentic pride promotes continued achievement; hubristic pride promotes status defense (Tracy & Robins, 2007).

### 4.4 Jealousy: A Rival Threatens My Valued Relationship

**Jealousy** arises when:

- **Self-state:** I have a valued relationship providing resources/benefits
- **Other-state (rival):** A third party may attract my partner’s investment
- **Other-state (partner):** My partner may redirect investment to rival
- **Self-other relation:** My relationship (and its benefits) is threatened
- **Viability prediction:** Loss of socially-mediated resources/reproduction
- **Action possibilities:** Mate-guard, rival-derogate, relationship-invest, devalue relationship

**Format:** Jealousy feels vigilant, suspicious, possessive, angry toward rival, anxious about partner. These ARE the action-relevant formats: monitor, protect, compete.

**Established finding:** Jealousy shows sex-differentiated patterns consistent with evolutionary pressures—men more reactive to sexual infidelity (paternity uncertainty); women more reactive to emotional infidelity (resource diversion) (Buss et al., 1992; though see DeSteno & Salovey, 1996 for alternative interpretations).

### 4.5 Envy: Another Has What I Lack

**Envy** arises when:

- **Self-state:** I lack something I desire
- **Other-state:** Another possesses what I lack
- **Self-other relation:** Upward comparison highlights my relative deprivation
- **Viability prediction:** I am at competitive disadvantage
- **Action possibilities:** Compete, acquire, derogate envied other, reframe comparison

**Format:** Envy feels bitter, resentful, motivated to close the gap (or bring the other down). This IS the action-relevant format: address relative disadvantage.

**Established finding:** Envy is distinct from admiration. Benign envy (admiration + motivation) promotes self-improvement; malicious envy promotes hostility toward the advantaged other (Van de Ven et al., 2009).

### 4.6 Gratitude: Another Has Benefited Me

**Gratitude** arises when:

- **Self-state:** I have received a benefit
- **Other-state:** Another intentionally provided the benefit at cost to themselves
- **Self-other relation:** A cooperative relationship exists or is being initiated
- **Viability prediction:** Social support is available; cooperation is viable
- **Action possibilities:** Reciprocate, strengthen relationship, signal appreciation

**Format:** Gratitude feels warm, appreciative, inclined toward the benefactor. This IS the action-relevant format: reinforce cooperative relationship.

**Established finding:** Gratitude functions as a “moral reinforcer” that strengthens cooperative relationships (McCullough et al., 2001). Expressing gratitude increases the benefactor’s future prosocial behavior (Grant & Gino, 2010).

### 4.7 Contempt: Another Is Beneath Consideration

**Contempt** arises when:

- **Self-state:** I have standards
- **Other-state:** Another has demonstrated incompetence or moral failure
- **Self-other relation:** The other is not a viable cooperative partner
- **Viability prediction:** Interaction with this other is costly, not beneficial
- **Action possibilities:** Dismiss, exclude, refuse engagement, signal low regard

**Format:** Contempt feels cold, distancing, superior. This IS the action-relevant format: disengage, do not invest in this relationship.

**Established finding:** Contempt has a distinctive unilateral lip curl expression recognized cross-culturally (Ekman & Friesen, 1986). It predicts relationship dissolution—contempt in marital interactions predicts divorce (Gottman & Levenson, 2000).

## 5. The Scaling Principle

### 5.1 Information-Based Interaction Across Levels

The same abstract pattern appears across scales:

|Level     |Unit    |Information Used                      |Behavior Guided              |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Atomic    |Atom    |Electron configuration of nearby atoms|Bonding, repulsion           |
|Neural    |Neuron  |Activation state of connected neurons |Fire / inhibit               |
|Cellular  |Cell    |Chemical signals from nearby cells    |Divide, differentiate, die   |
|Organismal|Organism|Behavioral signals from conspecifics  |Cooperate, compete, affiliate|
|Social    |Group   |Norms, reputation, coalition structure|Coordinate, sanction, exclude|

At each level:

1. Units have internal states
1. Units receive information about other units’ states
1. Behavior depends on own state + others’ states + resource constraints
1. Emergent dynamics arise from multi-unit interaction

### 5.2 Why This Scaling Occurs

**Resource constraints force interaction.** If resources were unlimited, units could operate independently. Scarcity creates interdependence—competition for limited resources, cooperation to access shared resources.

**Information reduces uncertainty.** Units that use information about other units can make better decisions. Atoms that “know” (via physical forces) whether another atom will bond can form stable molecules. Organisms that know whether another will cooperate can choose partners wisely.

**Evolution (at each level) selects for effective information use.** Chemical evolution selected atoms that form stable compounds. Biological evolution selected organisms that navigate social environments. Cultural evolution selected institutions that coordinate multi-agent behavior.

### 5.3 Social Emotions as Organism-Level Social Information

Social emotions are how organisms represent multi-agent information in action-relevant format.

They are not unique in kind—they are the organism-scale version of the same pattern that appears at every scale: units using information about other units to guide behavior under resource constraints.

**Theoretical claim:** This is why social emotions *feel* like something. They are not abstract representations of social facts. They are embodied, action-urging states because they guide organism behavior in high-stakes social situations, just as basic emotions guide organism behavior in high-stakes physical situations.

## 6. Computational Structure of Social Emotions

### 6.1 Multi-Agent Self-World Integration

Social emotions require computing:

**Own state:** What are my resources, capabilities, vulnerabilities, goals?

**Others’ states:** What are their resources, capabilities, goals, current actions?

**Others’ representations of me:** How do they evaluate me? What do they expect of me? What will they do based on their model of me?

**Social structure:** What are the norms? Who is allied with whom? What is my reputation?

**Predicted outcomes:** If I act this way, how will others respond? How will my social standing change? What resources will I gain or lose?

**Action selection:** Given all this, what should I do?

This is computationally intensive. It requires:

- Theory of mind (modeling others’ mental states)
- Recursive representation (modeling others’ models of me)
- Social knowledge (norms, relationships, reputations)
- Temporal prediction (how will interactions unfold?)
- Integration (combining all sources into action-relevant format)

### 6.2 The Computational Cost of Social Living

Social emotions may be cognitively expensive, which could explain:

**Dunbar’s number:** The ~150-person limit on human social groups may reflect cognitive limits on tracking social relationships (Dunbar, 1992, 1998). Social emotions require knowing others well enough to model their states and evaluations.

**Social brain hypothesis:** The disproportionate size of human neocortex (especially prefrontal regions) may reflect selection for social-cognitive capacities (Dunbar, 2009; Adolphs, 2009).

**Developmental trajectory:** Social emotions emerge later than basic emotions, coinciding with development of self-representation and theory of mind (Lewis, 2000; Tracy & Robins, 2007). The computational prerequisites must be in place first.

### 6.3 When Social Emotions Fail

If social emotions depend on accurate multi-agent modeling, failures of modeling should produce failures of social emotion:

**Autism spectrum:** Differences in social-emotional processing co-occur with differences in theory of mind and social cognition (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985; Hobson et al., 2006).

**Psychopathy:** Reduced guilt and shame co-occur with reduced empathy and altered representation of others’ suffering (Blair, 2007; Kiehl, 2006).

**Social anxiety:** Excessive shame and embarrassment co-occur with excessive estimation of others’ negative evaluation (Clark & Wells, 1995; Hofmann, 2007).

These patterns suggest that social emotions depend on the integrity of social-cognitive systems. They are not separate modules but emergent from self-other integration.

-----

## 7. Neural Implementation

### 7.1 Overlapping Systems for Self and Other

Social emotions recruit brain systems involved in both self-processing and other-processing:

**Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC):** Implicated in both self-referential processing and mentalizing about others (Amodio & Frith, 2006; Mitchell et al., 2006). Social emotions require integrating self and other representations—mPFC may support this integration.

**Temporoparietal junction (TPJ):** Involved in theory of mind and distinguishing self from other (Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003; Decety & Lamm, 2007). Social emotions require representing others’ perspectives, especially their evaluations of self.

**Anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC):** Involved in interoception, self-awareness, and empathy (Craig, 2009; Singer et al., 2004). Social emotions involve both self-state (interoception) and resonance with others’ states (empathy).

**Established finding:** Social emotions activate overlapping networks rather than discrete modules. Shame, guilt, pride, and embarrassment all involve mPFC, ACC, insula, and TPJ, with different patterns of activation (Bastin et al., 2016; Zahn et al., 2009).

### 7.2 The Self-Other Integration Circuit

**Hypothesis:** Social emotions are computed by integrating signals from:

1. **Interoceptive regions** (insula, ACC) → self-state
1. **Mentalizing regions** (mPFC, TPJ) → other-state, others’ representations of self
1. **Evaluative regions** (OFC, vmPFC) → value, norm compatibility
1. **Memory systems** (hippocampus, temporal cortex) → social knowledge, relationship history

The *integration* of these signals produces the social emotion. No single region is the “shame center” or “guilt center”—social emotions are network-level phenomena.

### 7.3 Mirror Systems and Social Resonance

Mirror neuron systems may contribute to social emotions by providing automatic resonance with others’ states (Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004; though see Hickok, 2009 for critical review).

**Theoretical connection:** When I observe another’s emotional expression, mirror systems produce partial activation of similar states in me. This provides rapid, pre-reflective information about others’ states that can feed into social emotion computation.

**Established finding:** Observing others’ emotional expressions activates similar neural patterns to experiencing those emotions (Wicker et al., 2003; Jabbi et al., 2007). This may support the “simulation” route to understanding others’ states.

-----

## 8. Cooperation, Defection, and Resource Constraints

### 8.1 The Fundamental Social Problem

In multi-agent environments with limited resources, agents face a fundamental problem:

**Cooperation** can produce mutual benefits exceeding what either agent could achieve alone (synergy, division of labor, risk pooling).

**Defection** can produce individual benefits by exploiting cooperators.

If everyone defects, the cooperative benefits are lost. If only some defect, defectors exploit cooperators. This is the structure of social dilemmas (Dawes, 1980; Kollock, 1998).

### 8.2 Social Emotions as Cooperation-Maintenance Mechanisms

Social emotions may function to maintain cooperation in the face of defection temptation:

**Guilt:** Imposes internal cost on defection. If I exploit a partner, guilt makes me feel bad, motivating reparation and deterring future defection (Frank, 1988).

**Gratitude:** Rewards cooperators. If you help me, gratitude motivates reciprocation, sustaining cooperation (McCullough et al., 2001).

**Shame:** Imposes cost on norm violation. If I violate group norms, shame makes me feel bad and signals submission, reducing punishment while deterring future violations (Fessler, 2007).

**Contempt/moral outrage:** Motivates punishment of defectors. If you violate norms, my contempt motivates exclusion or sanction, imposing costs on defection (Tooby et al., 2006).

**Established finding:** Social emotions align with predictions from evolutionary game theory. They impose costs and benefits that can stabilize cooperation in populations where pure rationality would predict defection (Frank, 1988; Trivers, 1971).

### 8.3 Reputation as Compressed Social History

**Reputation** = others’ aggregated representations of my past behavior.

Reputation solves an information problem: in large groups, you can’t interact with everyone. Reputation lets you use others’ experiences to predict how someone will behave toward you.

**Social emotions track reputation:**

- Shame responds to reputation damage
- Pride responds to reputation enhancement
- Guilt responds to behavior that could damage reputation if known
- Gratitude builds reputation for reciprocity

**Theoretical claim:** Reputation is a compression—an abstraction over interaction history that predicts future behavior. Social emotions are how agents manage this compressed representation. They motivate behavior that builds good reputation and avoid behavior that damages it.

### 8.4 Multi-Level Selection

The scaling principle suggests selection operates at multiple levels:

- **Individual selection:** Agents with effective social emotions outcompete those without (better cooperation, fewer costly conflicts)
- **Group selection:** Groups with well-functioning social-emotional norms outcompete groups with dysfunctional norms (Sober & Wilson, 1998; though group selection remains debated—see West et al., 2007)
- **Cultural selection:** Institutions and norms that effectively coordinate social emotions spread (Henrich, 2016; Boyd & Richerson, 2005)

Social emotions are shaped by selection at all these levels, producing the complex, culturally-tuned systems observed in humans.

## 9. Predictions and Falsification

### 9.1 Computational Predictions

**Prediction 1:** Social emotions should require intact theory of mind. Individuals with theory of mind deficits should show altered social emotions even with intact basic emotions.

*Status:* Partially supported (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985; Hobson et al., 2006). More specific tests needed separating social emotion from social cognition.

**Prediction 2:** Social emotions should be more cognitively demanding than basic emotions. Under cognitive load, social emotions should be more impaired than basic emotions.

*Test:* Compare emotional processing under cognitive load for social vs. basic emotions.

**Prediction 3:** Social emotions should track predicted social consequences, not just current social evaluation. Changing expectations about future social outcomes should change current social emotion.

*Test:* Manipulate predicted social consequences independently of current evaluation; measure social emotion.

### 9.2 Neural Predictions

**Prediction 4:** Social emotions should show integration of self-referential regions (mPFC, insula) and mentalizing regions (TPJ, mPFC). Disrupting connectivity between these regions should disrupt social emotions specifically.

*Test:* Use connectivity measures (fMRI, EEG coherence) and disruption methods (TMS, lesion) to test integration hypothesis.

**Prediction 5:** Individual differences in social emotion intensity should correlate with connectivity between interoceptive and mentalizing networks.

*Test:* Correlate social emotion measures with resting-state connectivity or task-based connectivity.

### 9.3 Behavioral Predictions

**Prediction 6:** Social emotions should respond to reputation-relevant information. Public behavior should elicit stronger social emotions than private behavior; behavior that affects reputation should elicit stronger social emotions than behavior that doesn’t.

*Status:* Supported (Leary et al., 1998; Shalvi et al., 2011). Further tests could manipulate reputation consequences directly.

**Prediction 7:** Social emotions should show scaling with group size and social complexity. Larger, more complex social environments should elicit more differentiated social emotions.

*Test:* Cross-cultural comparison of social emotion vocabulary and intensity in societies of varying size/complexity.

### 9.4 AI System Predictions

**Prediction 8:** AI systems without multi-agent embedding should fail at social emotion understanding. They may label social emotions but should fail at predicting when social emotions are appropriate, how intense they should be, and what actions they motivate.

*Test:* Evaluate LLMs on social emotion prediction tasks; compare to embodied multi-agent systems.

**Prediction 9:** AI systems trained in multi-agent environments with resource constraints and reputation dynamics should develop social-emotion-like states (functional equivalents) that guide cooperative behavior.

*Test:* Examine internal states of multi-agent reinforcement learning systems for social-emotion-like structure.

### 9.5 Falsification Criteria

The framework would be challenged by:

1. **Social emotions without theory of mind:** If social emotions are fully intact in individuals with profound theory of mind deficits, the multi-agent integration claim is wrong.
1. **Social emotions independent of reputation:** If social emotions are unaffected by reputation consequences, the reputation-tracking claim is wrong.
1. **No scaling pattern:** If social emotions in humans show no systematic relationship to social complexity or multi-agent computation, the scaling claim is unsupported.
1. **Disembodied social emotion understanding:** If LLMs show full human-like social emotion understanding without multi-agent embedding, the embodiment requirement is wrong.

-----

## 10. Implications

### 10.1 For Understanding Human Sociality

Social emotions are not evolutionary afterthoughts or cultural inventions. They are how embodied agents solve the multi-agent cooperation problem that all social species face.

This explains:

- Why social emotions feel so intense (they concern viability in high-stakes social environment)
- Why social pain resembles physical pain (both signal threats to viability)
- Why social emotions are universal yet culturally shaped (core function is universal; specific elicitors vary with social ecology)

### 10.2 For Artificial Intelligence

Social AI requires multi-agent grounding. A system that doesn’t exist in a multi-agent environment with real resource constraints and reputation consequences cannot develop genuine social emotional understanding.

This suggests that:

- Social AI should be developed in multi-agent contexts, not single-agent fine-tuning
- Reputation, cooperation, and defection dynamics should be part of training
- Mere language exposure is insufficient for social-emotional competence

### 10.3 For Mental Health

Social emotional disorders may be disorders of multi-agent self-world integration:

- **Social anxiety:** Overestimation of others’ negative evaluation
- **Narcissistic personality:** Dysregulated pride and shame; distorted self-other comparison
- **Antisocial personality:** Absent or reduced guilt; failure to represent others’ welfare in self-world integration

Treatment might target the integration process, not just individual emotions.

### 10.4 For Philosophy

The framework suggests social emotions are continuous with the rest of nature. They are the organism-level version of a pattern that appears everywhere: units using information about other units to guide behavior under resource constraints.

This is not reductionism in the sense of eliminating social emotions. It is naturalism in the sense of placing them in continuity with other information-processing systems. Social emotions are real, causally efficacious, and experientially vivid—AND they are part of the natural order.

-----

## 11. Limitations and Open Questions

### 11.1 Cultural Variation

The framework predicts universal core structure with cultural variation in specifics. But the boundaries between core and variable are not fully specified. How much cultural variation is consistent with the framework?

### 11.2 Individual Differences

Individuals vary in social emotion intensity, regulation, and expression. The framework doesn’t fully explain this variation—is it variation in integration capacity, in social valuation, in interoceptive sensitivity?

### 11.3 The Abstraction Level Question

At what level of abstraction is the scaling principle illuminating? Atoms, neurons, cells, organisms, and societies are very different. Does the pattern “units use information about other units” actually explain anything, or is it too abstract?

**Response:** The pattern is abstract but makes specific predictions at each level. At the organism level, it predicts that social emotions should track predicted social consequences, require multi-agent modeling, and serve cooperation maintenance. These predictions are testable.

### 11.4 Moral Emotions

Moral emotions (moral outrage, righteous anger, moral disgust) may extend beyond self-interest—we feel moral outrage at injustice to others. The framework handles this if “viability” includes group welfare that we have internalized. But this needs further development.

-----

## 12. Conclusion

Social emotions are not a special category requiring special explanation. They are the natural scaling of the embedded self-world framework to environments containing multiple agents.

When the world contains other selves—entities with their own goals, evaluations, and capacities—self-world integration must include self-other integration. Social emotions are the format in which this multi-agent information is presented for action selection.

This pattern scales:

- Atoms interact based on electron configurations
- Neurons interact based on activation states
- Cells interact based on chemical signals
- Organisms interact based on behavioral signals—including social emotions
- Societies interact based on norms and institutions built on social emotions

At every scale, units use information about other units to guide behavior under resource constraints. Social emotions are how embedded biological agents navigate the multi-agent cooperation problem.

They are not mysterious. They are not uniquely human (though human social emotions may be uniquely complex). They are not separate from basic emotions.

They are basic emotions in a world that includes other selves.
