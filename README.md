# Abstraction-Intelligence

**What makes something intelligent?**

The **Abstraction Primitive Hypothesis (APH)**: intelligence emerges from recursive interaction between symbol formation and compositional structure.

-----

## The Core Claim

**Abstraction is the recursive process of forming and composing symbols.**

```
    [Raw Input] → [Symbol Formation] → [Symbols] → [Composition] → [Composed Structures]
                         ▲                                              │
                         └──────────── [Feedback] ──────────────────────┘
```

Not symbols alone. Not composition alone. Their **mutual refinement through iteration**.

**Scoping the claim:** Non-abstractive processing exists—pure reactive systems with stimulus-response mappings but no symbol formation (thermostats, tropisms, basic reflexes). The framework’s load-bearing element is not “abstraction” as a label, but the *composition hierarchy* and its predicted dissociations. The claim: 3c-3d requires something beyond pattern matching. That’s testable independent of terminology.

**Biological grounding:** Neurochemical systems appear to implement compositional self-state abstraction—factorized dimensions (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GLP-1) that combine with world-state to produce context-appropriate behavior (see [Paper 18](papers/mind_body_neurochemistry.md)). This provides biological evidence that intelligent systems represent internal state compositionally, not as holistic snapshots.

## The Composition Hierarchy

|Type                 |Structure                  |Example                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|**3a: Concatenative**|A + B → AB                 |“blue bird”                               |
|**3b: Role-filler**  |R(x) + S(y) → R(x)S(y)     |AGENT(dog) + ACTION(chased) + PATIENT(cat)|
|**3c: Recursive**    |A contains [B contains C]  |“The dog [that chased the cat [that…]]”   |
|**3d: Analogical**   |Structure(A) → Structure(B)|atom:nucleus :: solar system:sun          |

**Computational framing:**

|Type  |Mechanism                            |Complexity                                                           |Formal basis                            |
|------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|**3a**|Sequence concatenation               |O(1) per operation                                                   |Finite automata                         |
|**3b**|Slot-filling / template instantiation|O(1) per slot                                                        |Finite automata                         |
|**3c**|Stack-based self-reference           |O(n) space for depth n                                               |Context-free grammars, pushdown automata|
|**3d**|Constraint satisfaction over mappings|Worst-case exponential (related to subgraph isomorphism, NP-complete)|Structure-mapping, graph matching       |

**The 3a-3b vs. 3c-3d divide:**

- **3a-3b:** Bounded combinatorial space. O(1) operations, finite state machines suffice. Pattern matching covers the space.
- **3c-3d:** Unbounded spaces. Require mechanisms beyond finite state. Pattern matching cannot precompute all cases.

**3c and 3d are computationally distinct:**

|                |3c (Recursive)                       |3d (Analogical)                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|What’s unbounded|Depth                                |Domain pairs                                   |
|Mechanism       |Fixed (stack + grammar)              |Search over mapping space                      |
|Complexity      |O(n) space                           |Worst-case exponential                         |
|Operation       |Apply bounded rule to unbounded depth|Search unbounded space of cross-domain mappings|

They’re both “unbounded” but in *different dimensions*. This raises the question: why group them?

**Hypothesized unity:** Both require **representing and manipulating relational structure** as opposed to surface features:

- **Recursion:** Relations *between levels* (embedding structure)
- **Analogy:** Relations *between elements* (mapping structure)

The shared primitive may be: **relational representation + structure-sensitive operations**. Systems that can’t represent relations abstractly (independent of surface features) should fail both.

**Prediction:** 3c and 3d failures should co-occur. Systems that fail recursive depth should also fail analogical mapping, and vice versa—because both depend on relational representation. Dissociation between 3c and 3d would challenge the unity hypothesis and suggest distinct underlying mechanisms.

**Prediction:** Systems show 3a-3b success with 3c-3d failure. Bees do role-filler (waggle dance), not recursion. LLMs degrade faster on recursive depth than role-filler novelty.

**Clarification on the boundary:** The claim is not “unlimited 3c-3d vs. zero”—humans also degrade on recursive depth (Gibson, 1998). The distinction is *construction with graceful degradation* vs. *pattern-matching with hard limits*:

|                 |Embedded (humans)                                        |Non-embedded (LLMs)       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|Degradation curve|Graceful                                                 |Threshold collapse        |
|Error structure  |Preserves recursive structure (shallower but grammatical)|Loses structural coherence|
|Scaffolding      |External memory extends capacity                         |Doesn’t help equivalently |

**Operationalizing construction vs. interpolation:** Depth alone isn’t the test—succeeding at depth 6 after training on 1-5 could be interpolation. The signatures:

- **Systematicity:** Novel combinations of familiar components (A[B] + C[D] → A[D]) when that combination wasn’t trained
- **Error structure:** When failing, does output preserve structural coherence or collapse randomly?
- **Generalization pattern:** Does performance track training distribution boundaries (interpolation) or extend beyond (construction)?

**On falsifiability:** The framework predicts *qualitative* signatures (error structure, systematicity), not just quantitative differences. But edge cases will be contested—any improvement could be framed as “more coverage” and any failure as “insufficient construction.” The clearest tests are systematicity and error structure, which are harder to explain away. Honest acknowledgment: some cases will be genuinely ambiguous.

## Embeddedness

Strong interaction requires **novelty detection**—recognizing unfamiliar against a background of familiar.

Novelty is relational. An input isn’t novel in itself—it’s novel *to a subject*. This requires:

1. **Persistent self** → accumulated experience (“what’s familiar to me”)
1. **Self/world distinction** → reference frame for locating novelty
1. **Embeddedness** → what makes persistence and self/world possible

```
Embeddedness → Persistent self → Familiar/unfamiliar distinction → Novelty detection → Pressure to expand primitives → Strong interaction
```

**Five components of embeddedness:**

- Action-consequence contingency
- Feedback closure
- Temporal persistence
- Self-boundary awareness
- Environmental stability

**On the five components:** These are proposed based on what seems necessary for novelty detection to matter. Whether all five are jointly necessary, have independent effects, or interact is hypothesis—not established. Partial embeddedness predictions are underspecified: would an LLM agent with strong temporal persistence and action-consequence contingency but no survival stakes show partial 3c-3d capacity? Worth testing.

**Operationalizing novelty detection:** To avoid circularity, we specify four measurable criteria independent of embeddedness:

|Criterion                     |Operationalization                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Calibration**               |Confidence decreases appropriately for OOD inputs (Guo et al., 2017)                     |
|**Processing differentiation**|Novel inputs trigger distinct internal processing, not just lower confidence             |
|**Response systematicity**    |Novel combinations of familiar components yield appropriate outputs (Lake & Baroni, 2018)|
|**Uncertainty propagation**   |Input novelty propagates to output uncertainty rather than confident confabulation       |

**Empirical status:** These are not definitional assertions—LLM failures on these criteria are empirically documented. Calibration failures: Guo et al. (2017). Systematicity failures: Lake & Baroni (2018). Confident confabulation: extensive hallucination literature. The hypothesis that embeddedness is *necessary* for meeting these criteria remains testable.

**Why stakes matter (hypothesis):**

Survival pressure creates asymmetric costs—misclassifying threat as familiar can be fatal; false alarms merely waste energy (Öhman et al., 2001). But why *different architecture* rather than just stronger optimization?

- **Phylogenetic vs. ontogenetic:** Stakes during *evolution* select for architectures; stakes during *operation* modulate which capacities are used. The claim: selection under stakes produced architecture capable of construction. LLMs weren’t selected; they were optimized on symmetric loss.
- **Asymmetric vs. symmetric pressure:** Symmetric loss (prediction error) rewards compression—minimizing average error. Asymmetric loss (survival) rewards worst-case handling—novel threats must be addressed even at efficiency cost. This selects for construction as a hedge against unbounded novelty. *(Testable: compare architectures trained under symmetric vs. asymmetric loss.)*
- **On the mechanism gap:** The prediction is that asymmetric pressure produces construction-capable architecture. The *full mechanism*—why asymmetric pressure yields construction rather than just more robust pattern-matching with better tail coverage—is not yet specified. The LC-NE gating hypothesis is suggestive but incomplete. This is an honest gap.
- **Candidate architectural feature:** Gating mechanisms that switch between retrieval and construction based on novelty. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system modulates exploration vs. exploitation based on uncertainty (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005). Biological cognition gates processing mode; LLMs apply identical forward passes regardless of input novelty.
- **Broader neurochemical evidence:** The LC-NE system is one instance of a general pattern: neurochemical systems provide factorized self-state signals that compose with world-state. Serotonin (metabolic adequacy), dopamine (incentive salience), norepinephrine (arousal), cortisol (resource mobilization), and GLP-1 (appetitive intensity) appear to encode distinct dimensions that combine with environmental context for action guidance. This suggests biological intelligence implements compositional self-state abstraction—not holistic state snapshots, but factorized dimensions enabling systematic combination with world-state. See [Paper 18](papers/mind_body_neurochemistry.md) for detailed treatment. If confirmed, this provides biological evidence that compositional structure extends to internal state representation, not just external world modeling.
- **On necessity:** Stakes are the known path to construction-capable architecture. Whether alternative paths exist is open. We claim *sufficiency* with confidence; *necessity* remains hypothesis.

**Why 3c-3d specifically (hypothesis):**

- **3a-3b:** Bounded combinatorial space. Can be encountered in training and stored. Pattern matching suffices.
- **3c-3d:** Unbounded generative space. Recursive depth extends indefinitely; analogical mappings span arbitrary domains. Cannot be precomputed.

When target space is unbounded, retrieval fails—*online construction* required. (See [Paper 10](papers/survival_pressure.md).)

**Compression vs. Generation:**

|              |Compression                                    |Generation                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|**Definition**|Finding structure within training distribution |Constructing outputs with no training coverage|
|**Operation** |Interpolation between known points             |Extrapolation into unbounded space            |
|**3a-3b**     |Sufficient (bounded space is coverable)        |Not required                                  |
|**3c-3d**     |Insufficient (unbounded space exceeds coverage)|Required                                      |

**Prediction:** Compression asymptotes on 3c-3d as coverable space is exhausted. Generation doesn’t asymptote because it’s not coverage-limited. Scaling improves compression; it doesn’t produce generation.

**On emergent capabilities:** Some argue LLMs show discontinuous capability jumps with scale, challenging the asymptote prediction. The empirical record is contested—Schaeffer et al. (2023) argue apparent emergence often disappears with continuous metrics. Some “emergent” capabilities may be 3a-3b improvements mistaken for 3c-3d. Whether genuine 3c-3d emergence occurs with scale is an open empirical question the framework takes seriously.

**On LLMs:** Within a conversation, LLMs have weak temporal persistence and action-consequence contingency. But they lack self-boundary awareness, cross-context stability, gating mechanisms, and stakes. This predicts principled 3c-3d limitations that scaling alone cannot overcome—hypothesis pending empirical test. Whether alternative paths to 3c-3d exist remains open.

**On in-context learning:** ICL shows within-context adaptation, including some systematic properties like inferring novel rules from examples. The open question: is this genuine construction or sophisticated retrieval? The framework predicts retrieval—ICL improves coverage (compression) rather than enabling construction (generation). But ICL’s systematic properties make this genuinely ambiguous; it’s testable, not settled.

## Relation to Other Frameworks

**Chollet’s ARC-AGI:** Chollet (2019) also emphasizes abstraction as core to intelligence, focusing on program synthesis and skill-acquisition efficiency.

|          |APH                                                       |Chollet/ARC                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|Core claim|Composition hierarchy matters; 3c-3d requires construction|Intelligence = skill-acquisition efficiency over novel tasks|
|Mechanism |Embeddedness → gating → construction                      |Program synthesis over core-knowledge priors                |
|Key test  |3a-3b vs 3c-3d dissociation                               |Few-shot generalization on novel tasks                      |

**Relationship:** Compatible, not competing. ARC tasks likely probe 3c-3d capacity (novel analogical mappings). Chollet’s efficiency focus and APH’s composition focus address different aspects. Program synthesis could be one *implementation* of construction. LLM failures on ARC despite scale are consistent with APH predictions.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Composition types dissociate (3a-3b vs. 3c-3d)                                                  |No differences found                                                 |
|3c and 3d failures co-occur (relational representation unity)                                   |3c and 3d dissociate                                                 |
|Recursive depth degrades faster than role-filler novelty                                        |Identical degradation curves                                         |
|Bees: role-filler yes, recursive no                                                             |Bees succeed at recursion                                            |
|Non-embedded systems fail novelty criteria (calibration, systematicity, uncertainty propagation)|System without embeddedness meets all four criteria                  |
|Systematicity failure: novel combinations fail despite component competence                     |Novel combinations succeed proportionally to component familiarity   |
|Systems without stakes plateau on 3c-3d despite scaling                                         |Scaled systems show continued 3c-3d improvement proportional to scale|
|Asymmetric loss training improves 3c-3d over symmetric loss                                     |No difference between loss types                                     |
|Neurochemical modulation shows cross-domain effects, dissociations, transfer structure          |Effects are idiosyncratic across domains with no systematic structure|

**Distinguishing embeddedness from architectural explanation:**

LLM 3c-3d limitations could stem from (a) lack of embeddedness/stakes, or (b) transformer architecture being compression-optimized for unrelated reasons. To distinguish:

|Condition           |Loss      |Persistence/Gating|Tests             |
|--------------------|----------|------------------|------------------|
|1. Baseline LLM     |Symmetric |No                |—                 |
|2. Loss only        |Asymmetric|No                |Loss alone        |
|3. Architecture only|Symmetric |Yes               |Architecture alone|
|4. Full embeddedness|Asymmetric|Yes               |Interaction       |

- If only (4) shows 3c-3d improvement → embeddedness necessary
- If (2) alone suffices → loss asymmetry is key mechanism
- If (3) alone suffices → architectural gating is key mechanism
- If (2) and (3) both help independently → multiple paths exist

**RL agents as test case:** If embeddedness is necessary for 3c-3d, RL agents trained under survival-like pressure in complex environments should develop construction capacity. If they don’t, stakes may be necessary but not sufficient—or phylogenetic timescales may matter in ways training runs can’t replicate.
