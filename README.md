# Abstraction-Intelligence

**What makes something intelligent?**

The **Abstraction Primitive Hypothesis (APH)**: intelligence emerges from recursive interaction between symbol formation and compositional structure.

---

## The Core Claim

**Abstraction is the recursive process of forming and composing symbols.**

```
    [Raw Input] → [Symbol Formation] → [Symbols] → [Composition] → [Composed Structures]
                         ▲                                              │
                         └──────────── [Feedback] ──────────────────────┘
```

Not symbols alone. Not composition alone. Their **mutual refinement through iteration**.

---

## The Composition Hierarchy

Not all composition is the same.

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **3a: Concatenative** | A + B → AB | "blue bird" |
| **3b: Role-filler** | R(x) + S(y) → R(x)S(y) | AGENT(dog) + ACTION(chased) + PATIENT(cat) |
| **3c: Recursive** | A contains [B contains C] | "The dog [that chased the cat [that...]]" |
| **3d: Analogical** | Structure(A) → Structure(B) | atom:nucleus :: solar system:sun |

**Prediction:** Systems show 3a-3b success with 3c-3d failure. Bees do role-filler (waggle dance), not recursion. LLMs degrade faster on recursive depth than role-filler novelty.

---

## Embeddedness

Strong interaction requires **novelty detection**—recognizing unfamiliar against a background of familiar.

Novelty is relational. An input isn't novel in itself—it's novel *to a subject*. This requires:

1. **Persistent self** → accumulated experience ("what's familiar to me")
2. **Self/world distinction** → reference frame for locating novelty
3. **Embeddedness** → what makes persistence and self/world possible

```
Embeddedness → Persistent self → Familiar/unfamiliar distinction → Novelty detection → Pressure to expand primitives → Strong interaction
```

Non-embedded systems can *process* the concept of novelty but cannot *detect* it—there's no accumulated self to whom something could be unfamiliar.

**Five components of embeddedness:**
- Action-consequence contingency
- Feedback closure
- Temporal persistence
- Self-boundary awareness
- Environmental stability

LLMs fail all five. This predicts principled Stage 4 limitations that scaling cannot overcome.

---

## Predictions

| Prediction | Falsification |
|------------|---------------|
| Composition types dissociate (3a-3b vs. 3c-3d) | No differences found |
| Recursive depth degrades faster than role-filler novelty | Identical degradation curves |
| Bees: role-filler yes, recursive no | Bees succeed at recursion |
| Non-embedded systems can't detect novelty | System without persistence shows genuine novelty detection |
