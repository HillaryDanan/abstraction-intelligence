## Directory Descriptions

### `/papers`
Formal theoretical papers with:
- Clear epistemic status labels (established, hypothesis, speculative)
- Testable predictions
- Falsification criteria
- Full references

**Reading order:**
1. `abstraction_is_all_you_need.md` — foundational framework
2. `recursive_abstraction.md` — when self-reference becomes necessary
3. `consciousness_emergent_abstraction.md` — consciousness as self-abstraction

### `/notes`
Working development materials:
- Literature review notes
- Theoretical development logs
- Draft ideas not yet formalized

### `/experiments`
Future empirical validation work:
- Code for testing predictions
- Data analysis
- Experimental protocols

Consciousness as Emergent Abstraction
```

Each paper builds on the previous:
- **AIAYN** establishes abstraction as the fundamental primitive
- **Recursive Abstraction** identifies when abstraction must include the system itself
- **Consciousness** applies this to biological self-modeling at sufficient complexity

## Versioning

Papers are working drafts. Major revisions will be noted in commit history. Version numbers in paper headers indicate draft status.

## Contributing

This is a personal theoretical project. Issues and discussions welcome for critique, suggestions, and empirical test proposals.
